(1, 1, 'Assassin\'s Creed', '<i>\"Jerusalem, the twelfth century. Amidst the chaos of the Third Crusade, a Brotherhood of warriors rose to power. Shrouded in secrecy, feared for their ruthlessness, they alone would save the Holy Land, or destroy it. They were the Assassins.\"</i><br>\r\n―Assassin\'s Creed pre-E3 2006 Trailer.<br><br>\r\nAssassin\'s Creed is a 2007 sandbox style action-adventure-stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The game was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2007 and for PC in April 2008.<br><br>\r\nThe game centers around the use of a machine dubbed the \"Animus\", which allows its user to view the genetic memories of their ancestors, centering around the protagonist, a bartender named Desmond Miles. As Desmond relives the memories of one of his ancestors, the Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La\'Ahad who lived in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade, details of a battle between two ancient sects – the Knights Templar and the Assassin Order – emerge as both scour for an artifact known only as a \"Piece of Eden.\"<br><br>\r\nAssassin\'s Creed received primarily positive reviews, for both its story and its gameplay, and received several awards at 2006\'s E3. In November 2009, a sequel in the form of Assassin\'s Creed II was released, building on the foundation set by Assassin\'s Creed.\r\n'),
(2, 1, 'Gameplay', 'Assassin\'s Creed is a non-linear action-adventure video game, during which the player controls a 12th-century Levantine Assassin named Altaïr Ibn-La\'Ahad during the Third Crusade, whose life is experienced through the Animus by his 21st century descendant, Desmond Miles. The overall goal of the game is to rise through the ranks of the Assassin Order by carrying out a series of assassinations given by the leader of the Order, Al Mualim. In doing so, Altaïr travels from Masyaf to cities in the Holy Land, specifically Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus.<br><br>Upon arrival in any of the cities, Altaïr must locate an Assassins\' Bureau and discuss his tasks with the local Rafiq, an agent of the Brotherhood, gaining basic knowledge of his target. From there, it is up to Altaïr to perform additional reconnaissance via eavesdropping, interrogation, meeting with informants, and gathering important items. It is only after Altaïr has gathered enough information that he can carry out the assassination. After successfully completing an assassination, Altaïr returns to Masyaf to debrief with Al Mualim, and is subsequently rewarded with better equipment, before he is given the names of his next targets.<br><br>Between main memories, Desmond must direct Altaïr to high points in the city to further synchronize his surroundings and map out the city that Altaïr is currently located in. Other side memories include tracking and killing Templars, flag collecting, and saving citizens who are being threatened by city guards.<br><br>Accompanying this, Altaïr needs to carry out most of his actions without being noticed by officials. The game uses a meter dependent on social stealth to inform the player of how noticeable Altaïr is to surrounding individuals, including the guards, by changing the color and shape of the Abstergo logo; performing certain actions at certain times may or may not raise the local area\'s awareness level. If an area is on high alert, indicated by the logo becoming red and the entire synchronization interface earning a red tinge and background, guards will be always vigilant and citizens will scatter in various directions in the event that the guards chase and attempt to bring down Altaïr. To reduce his notoriety, Altaïr must break the guards\' line of sight and then find a hiding place, blend in with wandering scholars, or join citizens sitting on benches.<br><br>To conduct many of the assassinations and various other tasks, Altaïr is capable of both high and low profile commands, both of which affect the alertness level. Low profile commands will allow Altaïr to blend into crowds, hide, and use Altaïr\'s Hidden Blade to attempt quiet and low profile assassinations. High profile commands increase alertness at a greater level and include free-running, attacking foes, and high profile assassination attempts. In the event that the player finds themself faced with multiple enemies, one can utilize Altaïr\'s sword-fighting abilities to combat guards.<br><br>This game introduces air assassinations and chain-kills. To do so, one must equip the Hidden Blade, climb to the top of a short building or hang from a ledge at an appropriate point, then look back, hold the high profile button and finally, press the attack button toward the desired target while running, hanging from a ledge, performing a wall eject or remaining close to the target from a suitable height. For chain-kills, one must equip the Hidden Blade while locked onto an enemy; hold the high profile button and counter-attack them with the Blade, and while another enemy reacts in surprise or is distracted, dash forward to assassinate them in turn.<br><br>Health in Assassin\'s Creed is measured as the level of synchronization between Desmond and Altaïr\'s memories. Whenever Altaïr is injured, it is experienced as a deviation from the actual memory that occurred and synchronization decreases. If there is complete desynchronization, the current memory that Desmond is experiencing dematerializes and restarts at the last stable checkpoint.<br><br>Because Altaïr\'s memories are rendered by the Animus software, \"glitches\" may often be experienced with nucleotides and error messages appearing. These glitches can be used to help identify targets and if the player reacts quickly enough, may be used to provide other vantage points during cut-scenes.'),
(3, 1, 'Plot', 'Desmond Miles, a bartender, is kidnapped by the company Abstergo Industries for use as a test subject in the \"Animus,\" a device that can simulate genetic memory. Abstergo intends to put Desmond in the device to recall the memories of his ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La\'Ahad, a member of the Assassin Brotherhood in the year 1191, who lived during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land. Initially, Desmond has trouble adjusting to the device, but eventually relives Altaïr\'s exploits over the next several days. The game then primarily changes to Altaïr\'s point-of-view, with occasional transitions to Desmond, due to problems with the Animus or onset of the Bleeding Effect.<br><br>The game opens with Desmond entering Altaïr\'s memory, but he soon faces synchronization problems. On this, Lucy Stillman and Warren Vidic\'s voices can be heard, arguing over Desmond\'s safety within the Animus. After experiencing a few problems, Desmond exits the virtual machine and Vidic briefs him about the Animus\' inner workings, before initializing the machine\'s tutorial program. After Desmond is done with the tutorial, he enters the closest synchronizable memory of Altaïr; Lucy adds that Desmond has to relive key moments of Altaïr\'s life to increase his synchronization, before reaching the final memory which holds the information that Abstergo is seeking.<br><br>Altaïr is first shown attempting to retrieve one of a series of artifacts known as the \"Pieces of Eden\" from Solomon\'s Temple with the help of Malik Al-Sayf, and his brother Kadar, but they are stopped by Robert de Sablé, Grand Master of the Knights Templar and sworn enemy of the Assassins. While retrieving the treasure, Altaïr breaks all three tenets of the Assassins\' Creed in an attempt to kill Robert, but he ultimately fails. In the following commotion, Malik\'s brother is killed, and Malik\'s left arm is crippled and later amputated. When Altaïr returns to the Assassins\' stronghold at Masyaf with apologies, Malik, who survived de Sablé, comes back with the artifact and disparages Altaïr because of his arrogance.<br><br>After narrowly defeating a retaliatory attack by the Templars, Al Mualim, leader of the Assassins, demotes Altaïr to a novice but gives him another chance to rise through the ranks of the Brotherhood. Al Mualim assigns Altaïr the task of assassinating nine key figures across the Holy Land in Jerusalem, Acre and Damascus, aiming to bring peace between the Crusader and Saracen forces. Each target is based on an actual historical figure from the Third Crusade, including Majd Addin, Garnier de Naplouse, Jubair al Hakim, Abu\'l Nuqoud, Sibrand, William of Montferrat, and Robert de Sablé.<br><br>Altaïr completes each task, learning how each target is connected to Robert and the Templars and how together they aim to end the Crusades and place the Holy Land under their own control. With men on both sides killed, he discovers that Robert\'s last plot is to attempt to unite the Christian and Muslim forces against their new common enemy, the Assassins themselves. Altaïr defeats de Sablé before Richard the Lionheart, failing to convince the King that an end to the war would be welcome to both sides, but ending Robert\'s plot. From de Sablé, Altaïr discovers that Al Mualim was himself a member of the Templars and used the Assassin to kill the other members who held the secret to the treasure\'s power, so that he could selfishly keep the artifact for himself.<br><br>Altaïr quickly returns to Masyaf and approaches his master, who reveals the truth to him: the Piece of Eden, which he had recovered through the help of Altaïr directly before his transgression, creates illusions. He denounces religion and other seemingly supernatural events (e.g. the Ten Plagues of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the presence of the Greek Gods in the Trojan War) as illusions caused by the Piece, and then states his intention to use the artifact to compel mankind into a brainwashed state, and in doing so, bringing an end to all conflict; Altaïr is eventually able to see through the deceptions created by the artifact to kill Al Mualim. When Altaïr recovers the artifact, the Piece of Eden activates, showing a holographic view of the world with numerous locations of other Pieces of Eden marked across the globe.<br><br>When the process is complete, Desmond learns that Abstergo is a modern-day front of the Templars, and they are already seeking other artifacts at locations identified in Altaïr\'s memories. Further, he learns that the modern-day Assassins had tried to rescue him before the memory had completed but had failed. Following this, Desmond was to be killed after an order from a high-ranking Templar, Alan Rikkin, but Lucy Stillman saves him from death and, at one point, tucks her ring finger into her palm, referring to the Assassins\' tradition of cutting off the finger.<br><br>Though Desmond remains trapped in the Abstergo laboratory, his experience in the Animus has created a Bleeding Effect of Altaïr\'s life in his own, allowing Desmond to use Altaïr\'s Eagle Vision, which, in turn, allows him to see strange messages painted on the walls of his room and the floor of the lab. The messages all deal with various forms of the end of the world from different cultures, including several references to 21 December 2012, the date that Abstergo plans to launch a satellite that will \"permanently end the war.\" It is hinted that this method would be by the same method that Al Mualim hypnotized Masyaf, only on a larger scale. Finally, the game ends with Desmond wondering what the images all mean and who could have drawn them.'),

(10, 2, 'Gameplay', 'Assassin\'s Creed II is similar to its predecessor in many ways. The game is non-linear, and can be considered a \"sandbox\" type of game due to the player\'s ability to freely roam the generated renditions of Italy. The Animus is replaced with the Animus 2.0, which, unlike the first, possesses an in-game database with historical information about encountered landmarks, characters, services, and glyphs.<br><br>Eagle Vision has been updated to allow for third-person view, which can be used while Ezio is moving. A young version of Leonardo da Vinci is also included in the game and translates Codex pages left behind by Altaïr Ibn-La\'Ahad, allowing for new weapons and upgrades. Other weapons, such as swords, daggers and maces can also be purchased throughout the game due to the economic system. Navigation has also been altered for the better in that swimming is now possible, alongside using gondolas and riding horses, as well as Leonardo further contributing to gameplay with the inclusion of his flying machine in one of the game\'s missions.<br><br>In Monteriggioni, the Auditore family\'s villa acts as Ezio\'s primary headquarters throughout the game, and a new economic system allows for the property to be upgraded and enhanced, creating income for Ezio at twenty minute intervals. As shops within Monteriggioni are renovated and upgraded, Ezio receives discounts on the particular goods that are sold, and income is also affected by the purchase of paintings, armor and weapon sets, along with the collections of various items. Such items are displayed throughout the villa as they are accumulated, and Ezio\'s personal room is updated with portraits of his assassinations as the game progresses.<br><br>The combat system for the game has been updated and allows for further options, including disarming opponents. There are also more methods of hiding, such as diving underwater to break an enemy\'s line of sight while swimming, along with the blending mechanic being improved to allow Ezio to cloak himself with any group of individuals, rather than specific people. Further along the game, Ezio is capable of learning new methods of assassination, such as ambushing individuals when hiding in haystacks or pulling individuals off buildings to fall to their deaths. Accompanying this, there are several new types of enemies, some more agile or stronger than others. As well as this, Ezio can use smoke bombs and hire groups of thieves, courtesans, or mercenaries to aid him in covering his tracks and avoiding contact with guards. Health in the game is measured via synchronization, and minor wounds will heal automatically over time, while major wounds must be healed by side-street doctors or with medicine purchased from them.<br><br>One new feature includes a new system known as notoriety, which, depending on his behavior, current location, and current mission, Ezio will become more recognizable by citizens of the city, specifically guards. When the notoriety icon is empty, Ezio is known as \"incognito\" and may travel through the city as he pleases. As the player behaves in more \"socially unacceptable\" ways or due to the consequences of a particular mission, Ezio will become more noticeable by the guards and more likely to be pursued by them. Notoriety can be decreased by bribing city heralds, assassinating corrupt city officials, and removing wanted posters. The level of notoriety is set within each city, so that while Ezio may be completely unknown in some cities, he may be infamous in others.<br><br>Like its predecessor, the game features the same ability to climb buildings and perform Leaps of Faith into haystacks and carts of soft materials, including herb and spice carts. Climbing has been updated to allow Ezio the opportunity to learn to leap while climbing, allowing him to reach higher positions previously unavailable.<br><br>A day and night cycle has been added to the game, which the player can notice via the sun rising and setting throughout gameplay. In addition, specific missions and game events occur at certain times in the day or night.<br><br>Due to complaints of some of the missions in the original game, Assassin\'s Creed II\'s mission system has been expanded and structured a little differently. There are approximately 200 missions in the entire game with roughly half of them being relevant to the primary storyline. Side quests include the location and search of hidden areas which upon exploration and successful completion will reward Ezio with seals of past Assassins. On the full collection of the six seals, Ezio will be allowed to claim the mighty armor of Altaïr.<br><br>The game also possesses a system mildly similar to the \"glitches\" from Assassin\'s Creed, where pressing a specific button during a cutscene will produce specific changes and actions within the scene.'),
(11, 2, 'Plot', 'The game begins with Desmond giving a brief monologue about the events of the first game and his current predicament. A few hours after the events of Assassin\'s Creed, in the year 2012, Desmond Miles touches upon how he was held prisoner by the modern-day Knights Templar, Abstergo Industries, and was being forced to relive the genetic memories of his ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La\'Ahad, in order to aid Abstergo in discovering the location of artifacts known collectively as the \"Pieces of Eden\".<br><br>Due to the \"Bleeding Effect\", Desmond has gained \"Eagle Vision\", enabling him to see a variety of messages and symbols written in blood on his bedroom wall by its former occupant, known only as \"Subject 16\". While staring at the message, former employee and researcher of Abstergo, Lucy Stillman, arrives, covered in blood, and frees Desmond from the room. He then re-enters the Animus briefly and watches the birth of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, as she makes a copy of the files located within the machine. The two then escape after a brief scuffle with the company\'s security guards and arrive at a warehouse in which Lucy and two other modern day Assassins, Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, have set up their own base of operations, complete with their own version of an Animus.<br><br>Desmond is asked by Lucy to enter their version of the Animus and relive the genetic memory of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze, in order to continue the search for the remaining Pieces of Eden before Abstergo locates them.

Ezio\'s father\'s final instructions lead him to a hidden room in the family home with a chest containing the clothing and weapons of an Assassin. Ezio is ultimately unable to save his two brothers and father from the betrayer and all three are falsely convicted of treason and hanged.<br><br>After evacuating their home and sharing a brief accommodation with the family\'s housemaid\'s sister, who teaches Ezio some survival techniques, he brings his panicked sister and muted mother to the family\'s countryside villa, where they are given shelter by Ezio\'s uncle Mario, who begins training Ezio to become an Assassin. Mario also provides information and leads on the conspirators involved in his family\'s betrayal, which becomes a trail stretching from Florence to San Gimignano, Forlì, Venice, and eventually the Vatican.<br><br>During his travels, Ezio befriends several citizens of Italy who aid him in his pursuit for revenge, including a young Leonardo da Vinci, who translates and decodes pages of Altaïr\'s Codex, enabling Ezio to gain new weapons and assassination skills. Ezio begins slowly locating and assassinating the conspirators involved, and is ultimately able to identify Rodrigo Borgia as the Grand Master of the Italian Templars, whose main goal is to take control of all of Italy.<br><br>Ezio tracks Rodrigo to Venice and discovers that he has obtained a Piece of Eden known as \"the Apple\", an artifact similar to the one that Altaïr possessed almost three centuries prior. Rodrigo has been researching the knowledge surrounding the Pieces of Eden extensively and believes himself to be a prophet named in the documentation of the artifacts, which would ultimately lead him and other Templars to a location known as \"The Vault\", which is believed to contain powerful information and more Pieces of Eden.<br><br>Ezio and Rodrigo duel and when Ezio gains the upper hand, guards appear and begin to move the fight into the favor of Rodrigo. The allies that Ezio has made over the years arrive shortly after and they defeat Rodrigo, who flees for fear of his life, leaving the Apple behind. These allies and friends of Ezio finally reveal their common trait – that they are all members of the Assassins, including the great Niccolò Machiavelli. They induct Ezio into the Order, informing him that they believe him to be the actual prophet who will lead the Assassins, not the Templars, to the Vault.<br><br>Desmond takes short breaks from the Animus, and during one he is tested by Lucy to see if the Bleeding Effect has been working. Desmond is able to demonstrate all of Ezio\'s skills, indicating that he has absorbed years worth of abilities in only a matter of hours. During this break, however, Desmond suffers a strange hallucination which returns him to the body of Altaïr in Acre. During the memory, Altaïr makes love to Maria Thorpe, an ex-Templar, and Desmond is confused to find that after Altaïr leaves, the memory stays behind with Maria.<br><br>Throughout the genetic memories as Ezio, Desmond discovers multiple glyphs placed on various landmarks that are only visible to someone using the Animus. The glyphs are found to be the same ones drawn on Desmond\'s bedroom wall in Abstergo, and analysis reveals that they contain computer code, hidden within the Animus. It is ultimately discovered that Subject 16 hacked the Animus and placed the glyphs within the memories himself, which were carried over to the new Animus when Lucy loaded the information she had recovered at Abstergo. Each glyph contained a great number of historical artworks, photographs, and messages, past and present, implicating a great number of prominent events and figures with the Templars and Pieces of Eden. Each also contained a puzzle of some sort which, when solved, contained clips of a larger video. The clips, however, are short and out of sequence. After locating and solving all twenty glyphs, a video is revealed.<br><br>The video begins with the Abstergo logo shown above the title, \"Subject 16, Session 12, Classified Date B.C.E.\" The video follows a man and woman, who call each other by the names of \"Adam\" and \"Eve\", running through a strangely modern and futuristic world, apparently being chased by someone or something. They pass through a complex where workers are busy building more Pieces of Eden and climb to the roof. Eve holds up the Apple and the video suddenly ends with a flash of binary code that translates to \"Eden\".<br><br>Desmond returns to the Animus and the team finds that many of the following memories are corrupted. They are able to begin again but only years after the fight between the Assassins and Rodrigo. The memories restart in 1499 and the team discovers that the latter gained influence and power in the Catholic Church, ultimately being elected Pope as Alexander VI. Ezio and his allies have searched long and hard and collected all thirty pages of the Codex, discovering through it that the Vault lies in Rome, specifically underneath the Vatican. They realize that the Papal Staff is another Piece of Eden and Rodrigo is hoping to use it to achieve access to the Vault.<br><br>Ezio travels to the Vatican and attempts to assassinate Rodrigo, who uses the Staff against Ezio, who retaliates with the Apple. During the ensuing battle, Ezio is stabbed and Rodrigo escapes with both Pieces of Eden. Ezio then chases after him and finds Rodrigo trying to open the Vault in vain. The two fight once more and Rodrigo finally falls. However, Ezio refuses to kill him, insisting he has killed enough in his life and the continued deaths will not reverse the fate of his family.<br><br>Ezio proves himself to be the Prophet when in his hands, the Apple and Staff open the Vault. Inside the Vault, he finds not Pieces of Eden but an empty room and a holographic figure named Minerva. She claims that she brought Ezio to her so that almost six hundred years later, Desmond and his allies would hear her words through the Animus.<br><br>Minerva explains that she and her race were part of an advanced society that settled on Earth before a celestial event destroyed most of the life on Earth. Before the disaster that befell them, the members of her species created humans and used them as a race for workforce. However, humanity rebelled against their creators and initiated a long-spanning war. Ultimately, the humans seemingly won, but then the catastrophe occurred, wiping out many humans and the precursor race. Of those remaining, the two species worked to recreate the world, before the advanced race sealed themselves in temples around the world, hoping to prevent the same disaster that had destroyed most of their kind from happening once again. As Minerva finishes, she speaks to Desmond by name and informs him that she has done all she needs to and that the rest remains up to him and his allies.<br><br>The memory ends and Desmond awakens in the present to find that Abstergo has located and begun attacking the Assassins as Shaun and Rebecca pull him out of the Animus. Desmond is given a Hidden Blade by Lucy and the two run downstairs to stop the guards as Shaun and Rebecca pack up their equipment. With the skills he absorbed from Ezio, Desmond is able to dispatch the forces that have been sent against them and he discovers Warren Vidic standing in the back of a truck. He sarcastically tells Desmond to enjoy his temporary victory and the truck drives away. From there, Shaun and Rebecca finish gathering the equipment and Lucy assures Desmond that Vidic will get what he deserves.<br><br>The group vacates the hideout and attempts to find a new safehouse, where, according to Lucy, they should be safe for some time. As they drive, Lucy prepares to review the tapes of Desmond\'s latest session, noting how the situation has escalated dramatically and how Minerva\'s words proved everything she was afraid of. She theorizes that Minerva was discussing the Earth\'s geomagnetic reversal, which could have detrimental effects on the planet. Rebecca prepares the Animus for Desmond to re-enter as Lucy speculates there may be more to discover in his memories.'),

In addition, the poison darts have also been introduced as an extension to the Poison Blade, which can be gained through upgrades from Leonardo da Vinci himself, along with the second Hidden Blade and the Climb Leap Glove. Also, every utility in Ezio\'s weapon wheel can now be manually assigned to one of the four quick-access buttons, instead of being given a default setup.<br><br>Horse mechanics have also been upgraded. Ezio can now take a horse through city districts rather than just the countryside, and can call for his horse at any given time while free-roaming. Combat on horseback now allows Ezio to utilize some of his ranged weapons, namely the Hidden Gun and the crossbow.

Several civilians being harassed by the Borgia can be rescued by Ezio, and will pledge their allegiance to him once saved. While in Rome, Ezio can command several apprentices to incapacitate guards on his command, and can call forth an arrow storm once he has recruited enough apprentices. Ezio can also send apprentices to other countries in Europe and Asia to take on contracts, wherein they can gain additional experience, as well as money and trade objects for Ezio. Apprentices gain experience while under Ezio, gaining better equipment as they go along, until they can be fully initiated into the Order, wherein they gain superior equipment and armor and becoming fully fledged Assassins.

(18, 3, 'Plot', 'Using the Animus 2.0, Desmond Miles attempted to relive one of the later memories of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore, hoping that it would reveal the location of his Apple of Eden, which could allow them to prevent the foretold disaster. However, instead of entering the memory set in 1506, he was forced into a different one, occurring during a battle in Viana. From there, as Ezio looked upon the besieged Viana Castle, he recalled the similar events of the Siege of Monteriggioni, subsequently forcing Desmond back further, into a memory from 1499.<br><br><h4>Siege of Monteriggioni</h4><br>As Ezio left the Vault beneath the Vatican after listening to Minerva\'s message, he discovered that Rodrigo Borgia was gone. Noticing too that the Staff had been left behind, he attempted to extract it from where it had been impaled into the floor; however, it descended and was sealed away.<br><br>Mario Auditore then called down to him from the entrance, and he and Ezio fought their way out of the Vatican. Ezio, unable to decide whether or not to cast the Apple into the Tiber River, gave it to Mario for safe keeping. The two then rode back to Monteriggioni on horseback.<br><br>However, Ezio soon learned that the Templar threat had diminished little, when Cesare Borgia, son of Rodrigo Borgia, laid siege to Monteriggioni. Cesare\'s army of soldiers, towers, and cannons attacked in full force, destroying much of the city and villa. The attack ended with Monteriggioni in ruins, Ezio wounded badly by arquebusiers, and Mario killed by Cesare himself. Though Ezio attempted to follow his uncle\'s murderer on horseback, he passed out on the road to Rome from his injuries.<br><br>At that point, Desmond woke from the Animus stationed in the back of the Assassins\' van, they having arrived at the Villa Auditore in modern Monteriggioni, their last safehouse in Italy. Lucy Stillman explained that they need to recover Ezio\'s Apple of Eden, as she suspected that Minerva had altered it somehow when she had touched it in the Vault.<br><br>Desmond, Lucy, Shaun and Rebecca then headed for the Villa, seeking the safety of the underground Sanctuary, which would keep them hidden from Abstergo\'s cell towers. However, as the door was locked, Desmond and Lucy left to discover another way in. After making their way through the secret passage that Ezio and the citizens had used to flee the Borgia attack, they opened the way for Shaun and Rebecca.<br><br>Inside the Sanctuary, Desmond saw an aged Ezio due to the bleeding effect, and deduced that he must have returned to the villa many years after the attack, though for an unknown purpose. He also found a symbol that Ezio had drawn on the wall and, using Eagle Vision, saw a series of numbers hidden underneath.<br><br>The four of them then set up the Animus 2.0, and Desmond returned to Ezio\'s memories, with Lucy believing that improving his synchronization with Ezio would allow Desmond to access the memory revealing the location of the Apple.<br><br><h4>War in Rome</h4><br>Ezio regained consciousness in a small house in Rome, where the woman who had been tending to him told him that a man had brought him there, and had supplied him with new armor and clothing. After leaving the house and receiving medicine from a doctor, Ezio left to meet with Niccolò Machiavelli.<br><br>Through Machiavelli, he discovered that Rome was in disrepair, and that the citizens were being oppressed by the Borgia. Later, he would also stumble across the Followers of Romulus, and explore one of their lairs, Nero\'s Golden Palace.<br><br>Basing himself on Tiber Island in the center of the city, Ezio began his mission to rid the city of the influence of Cesare and his generals. To do so, Ezio re-established relationships between his Assassins Guild and the other guilds in the city, namely that of the Courtesans (led by madonna Solari, and later Claudia Auditore), the Thieves (led by La Volpe) and the Mercenaries (led by Bartolomeo d\'Alviano).<br><br>Ezio then began to rebuild the Brotherhood by recruiting Apprentices, who were made up of both distressed citizens who wished to liberate their city, and young novice Assassins, such as Francesco Vecellio. After the recruits had completed their training, he placed them in teams and sent them on missions across Europe.<br><br>Ezio then began to break down the Borgia influence in Rome by destroying several Borgia towers and their captains. He also sabotaged Cesare\'s forces by striking at their arsenal, their military funding, and their support from the French forces. To do so, he destroyed the war machines of Leonardo da Vinci, and assassinated two of Cesare\'s key generals, his Banker, Juan Borgia, and the French general, Octavian de Valois.<br><br>Afterwards, he was informed that Pietro Rossi, an actor and Lucrezia Borgia\'s plaything, possessed a key to the Castel Sant\'Angelo. Knowing that he would need it in order to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo successfully, Ezio tailed after Micheletto Corella, Cesare\'s personal assassin, who had been sent to kill Pietro. After Ezio had rescued him, both from being stabbed with a spear during his play, and from the ailments of poison, Pietro handed the Assassin the key to the Castello.<br><br>Upon completion of these tasks, Ezio inducted Claudia into the Assassin Order, and was also elected by Machiavelli to be the new Mentor of the Italian Assassins.<br><br><h4>The Fall</h4><br>Soon afterwards, Ezio infiltrated the Castel, where he witnessed the murder of Rodrigo by his son, Cesare. Cesare forced the location of the Apple of Eden from Lucrezia, and hurried to retrieve it from Basilica di San Pietro. However, Ezio successfully reached the Apple before Cesare, and subsequently used it to demilitarize the remnants of Cesare\'s army.<br><br>In one last battle, Ezio and his fellow Assassins fought Cesare and his surviving men at the gates of Rome. Cesare was arrested by Fabio Orsini by the order of the new Pope, though not before commenting that he would not be in chains for long and that he would never be killed by any man.<br><br>Afterwards, Ezio brought up Cesare\'s remarks with Leonardo since he was worried by them. Leonardo suggested utilizing the Apple to see if what Cesare had stated was accurate. After some hesitation, Ezio decided to follow his advise and found that Cesare would really be released from prison. Ezio declared that he needed to leave at once, reassuring Leonardo\'s concerns for the Assassin Guild he was leaving behind by saying, \"I built this Brotherhood to last, with or without me.\"<br><br><h4>Viana</h4><br>In 1507, Ezio finally tracked Cesare down at the Siege of Viana, Spain. Ezio fought through the infantry, and finally managed to corner Cesare on the castle wall. There, in a climactic battle, Ezio managed to destroy Cesare\'s armor and ultimately defeat him. Though Cesare insisted that he would not die in the hands of man, Ezio then left him to the \"hands of fate,\" and threw him from the battlements to his death.<br><br>Afterwards, Ezio took the Apple of Eden into a Vault under the Santa Maria Aracoeli, within the Temple of Juno.<br><br><h4>Recovering the Apple</h4><br>Desmond emerged from the Animus shortly after reliving this memory, listening to his teammates deducing a way to get into the Vault. Just as Rebecca mentioned that they needed a spoken password to enter it, a blackout occurred, cutting them off from using the Animus to find out. However, Desmond realized that the symbol he had seen on the door of the Vault was the same one he had seen drawn on the villa wall. Shaun discovered that the sequence of numbers hidden behind the symbol referred to the seventy-two names of God, setting the password to be 72.<br><br>The Assassins then drove to the Colosseo in Rome, and Desmond separated from the others to find a way into the Vault. As he traveled the underground passageway, he encountered another of Those Who Came Before, Juno, who spoke at length of the downfall of humankind.<br><br>Arriving inside the Santa Maria Aracoeli, Desmond unlocked the door for his teammates and, shortly afterwards, witnessed a memory of Ezio free-running through the church. He followed him and activated a system of bars and levers, finally causing a small pedestal to emerge from the floor. Placing his hand on it, Desmond activated the floor, lowering the four of them down to the door of the Vault.<br><br>Desmond spoke the password, and the door opened to reveal a large empty chamber, with a tall platform raised in the middle, upon which the Apple awaited. Desmond activated the staircase up to it by jumping across a series of pillars; while Juno\'s voice echoed through the cavern as she spoke cryptically of humans, the Pieces of Eden and a \"sixth sense.\" However, Desmond was apparently the only one who could hear her.<br><br>Once the Assassins had access to the platform, Desmond touched the Apple, and a series of holographic symbols appeared.<br><br>Shaun mentioned that two of the most distinct ones, the Phrygian Cap and the Masonic Eye, only came together in one place; however, when Desmond picked up the Apple, time seemed to stop and he found himself controlled by Juno. Though he struggled, she forced him to draw his Hidden Blade and stab Lucy in the abdomen. The two then fell to the ground unconscious, with blood pooling around Lucy.<br><br>Later, William Miles and Harlan T. Cunningham could be heard speaking, saying that Desmond had gone into shock. William ordered Harlan to put Desmond back into the Animus, despite Harlan\'s protests on how badly the Animus had affected Desmond already. Desmond had entered a coma, though William claimed that Desmond would live through it.'),

While Shaun Hastings stayed behind in Rome to attend Lucy\'s funeral, William and Rebecca Crane monitored Desmond\'s condition while they headed for the city of New York.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWithin the Black Room, Desmond met the virtual construct of Abstergo\'s sixteenth test subject, Clay Kaczmarek, who explained that in order for Desmond to regain his consciousness, he must relive the remaining memories of his ancestor – Ezio Auditore da Firenze – until a Synch Nexus triggered. Entering a digital portal within the Black Room, Desmond began reliving the later life of Ezio, who was now in his early 50s and on his way to Masyaf.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn March of 1511, Ezio traveled to Masyaf after he discovered a letter by his late father regarding the secret library of the Assassin Mentor Altaïr Ibn-La\'Ahad – that was rumored to contain his invaluable knowledge – hidden beneath the old Assassin fortress. There, he was greeted by a battalion of Templars led by Leandros, whose forces managed to overwhelm Ezio in a fight; in the midst of his execution, Ezio escaped and made his way back into the fortress. He later found the entrance to the library, but learned that it needed special keys in order for it to be unlocked.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe hired worker that was present in the antechamber to the library mentioned to Ezio that the Templars found one of the keys beneath the Ottoman Sultan\'s palace, while speculating that the book held by Leandros would lead them to the others. With this in mind, Ezio set out of the fortress to take the book from Leandros, and eventually killed the Templar captain at Atlas Village after a long chase. After obtaining the book, Ezio set out for Constantinople, where the rest of the keys were hidden.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBy May, Ezio had arrived at Constantinople, where he met a young man before docking, and was greeted by the leader of the local guild, Yusuf Tazim, right after his arrival. Yusuf gave Ezio a tour of the city, introducing him to the guild and showing what was left of the Byzantine empire within the city. Ezio also received a Hookblade and was taught how to use it. In return, Ezio later assisted with defending and retaking some of the city\'s Assassin Dens from the Templars.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter helping the guild recruit a few new initiates and being taught how to use bombs, Ezio went to the first location of the keys: the old trading post of Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, now a book shop owned by Sofia Sartor, a woman whom Ezio first saw during his ferry to the city. After an introduction, Ezio found an entrance into the Yerebatan Cistern, where he found the first key along with a tome and an encrypted map that led to rare books which held the location of the other keys. Striking up a mutual agreement, Ezio made a promise with Sofia: if she helped decipher the map, he would let her borrow and print a few copies of the books.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his search, Ezio helped Yusuf save the Ottoman prince from a planned assassination. Dressed as a minstrel, Ezio managed to stop the assassination, which earned him the favor of the prince; the same young man whom he met on his way to the city, Suleiman I. Following this, Ezio later met with Suleiman in order to learn of the perpetrator behind the attack, whom they suspected was the Janissary captain, Tarik Barleti.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTailing Tarik, Ezio soon found out that the man had dealings with Manuel Palaiologos, the former heir of the Byzantine throne; with this knowledge, Suleiman requested that Ezio assassinate Tarik. However, in his dying moment, Tarik revealed that his forces were to ambush Manuel after gaining his favor. Before dying, Tarik entrusted Ezio to continue his plan, and set sail for Derinkuyu, Cappadocia.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn between his tasks for Suleiman, Ezio continually searched for the books with Sofia\'s help, all the while gaining her favor and assisting her with some errands. Ezio grew fond of Sofia\'s company, but he could not reveal his affiliations or occupation to her, for he feared that it would endanger her. She and Ezio eventually had to part ways for the time being, as Sofia sailed for Adrianopoli; before leaving, Ezio left Sofia to Yusuf\'s care during his absence. With each book, he was able to retrieve one of the keys from one of the many secret locations, and with each one, he was able to relive some key moments of Altaïr\'s life.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe first key showed his heroic efforts in 1190, where Altaïr saved Masyaf from an attack by the traitor Haras. The second key detailed his Mentor Al Mualim\'s pyre and Abbas Sofian\'s failed rebellion through utilizing an Apple of Eden, which Altaïr later retrieved. The third memory detailed Altaïr\'s fall from power in 1228; after defeating Genghis Khan\'s army with his son Darim and wife Maria, Altaïr found out that Abbas had usurped command from Altaïr\'s appointed proxy Malik Al-Sayf, and that his son Sef was murdered by Swami, Abbas\' right-hand man.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAltaïr confronted Abbas and his loyalists, but was overcome with rage and used the Apple for revenge, which ultimately caused the death of both Swami and Maria. In the wake of this incident, Altaïr left Masyaf with Darim before Abbas could apprehend them. The fourth key showed Altaïr\'s return to power in 1247, with the help of several Assassins who grew tired of Abbas\' rule; he achieved this through Abbas\' death at his hands, where Altaïr used his newly crafted Hidden Gun.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll the while reliving Ezio\'s last memories, Desmond had several encounters with Clay in the Animus Island, also overhearing conversations between his father, Rebecca, and Shaun. Desmond also relived his own memories in a very different simulation, wherein he reached the core of the Animus. There, a recollection of his life was told; Desmond grew up in a small community called \"The Farm,\" but soon fled due to his parents\' strict rule. There he drifted from place to place, eventually settling in New York, and found a job as a bartender at a venue named Bad Weather. His recollection lasted up until his capture by Abstergo, and his time in their facility.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEzio arrived at Cappadocia by March 1512 with Piri Reis, after destroying Constantinople\'s Great Chain. There, he met with Tarik\'s informant Dilara at the city of Derinkuyu. Dilara was eventually captured after she and Ezio parted ways, and was being held by Shahkulu, Palaiologos\' partner. With haste, Ezio rescued Dilara, though she departed to save what was left of her men from Shahkulu. In the city, they learned that Shahkulu planned to beat one of Dilara\'s men, Janos, to death; Ezio stopped the public beating and killed Shahkulu after a tough fight. Afterwards, Ezio planned to burn the fake artillery given to Manuel by Tarik, which will cause the artillery\'s authentic gunpowder to explode.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEzio was successful in infiltrating the city\'s armory, and managed to cause an explosion that ensued enough chaos to draw out Manuel Palaiologos. The Assassin then managed to corner Manuel after a long chase, and killed him before he could escape by the city\'s inner harbor. As a result, Ezio managed to obtain the last key from Manuel. Just then, Ezio saw Prince Ahmet – uncle of Suleiman and whom Ezio had encountered on several occasions – on a ship with the Byzantines. Ahmet revealed his true role as the Byzantine Templars\' leader. There, he threatened Ezio into handing over the key, and after the Assassin\'s refusal, Ahmet threatened to hold Sofia Sartor captive. Despite Ezio\'s warnings, Ahmet went ahead and set sail back to Constantinople. Hurriedly, Ezio escaped the burning city and made his way back to his boat, and on the way back, he relived the fifth key\'s memory of Altaïr\'s life.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe fifth key revealed Altaïr\'s twilight years in 1257; Niccolò and Maffeo Polo were preparing to leave for Constantinople, to establish a guild, after their stay in Masyaf. At the time, the invading Mongols drew near the city. Altaïr gave the brothers his Codex as a parting gift and escorted them out of the city with Darim, defeating any Mongol who drew near by using his Apple of Eden. As the brothers left on their horses, Altaïr gave him the keys, which he asked to be hidden from others, so that the one who was meant to know the message could seek it out.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEzio later returned to Constantinople, hurriedly making his way to Sofia\'s book shop. There, he found a platoon of Assassins dead, as well as Yusuf, who had a message for Ezio attached to his corpse via a dagger to the back. Filled with rage at the slaughter, Ezio made his way to the Harbor of Theodosius and stormed the area with the guild\'s many apprentices. There he found Ahmet, and threatened him for Sofia\'s location. However, he only agreed to release her on the condition that Ezio meet him by the Galata Tower with all of the Masyaf keys. As Ahmet left, Suleiman revealed himself to Ezio, who asked him to stop his uncle\'s ambitions, without killing him if possible.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEzio later met with Ahmet after appointing a new leader for the Turkish guild. During the meeting, Ahmet had one of his men hold Sofia by the edge of the Galata Tower. Pressured into a decision, Ezio gave the keys to Ahmet and went to Sofia\'s rescue. However, the woman was only a decoy, and the real Sofia was about to be hanged somewhere else. Ezio hurriedly made his way to her, managing to save her in time. As Sofia recovered, Ezio watched as Ahmet\'s carriage left the city, before he spurred himself and Sofia onto one of their own to give chase. Fortunately, Ezio managed to catch up to Ahmet by the city\'s countryside, eventually causing his carriage to fall, along with Ahmet and himself. As they fought while falling, Ezio utilized his parachute to save himself and Ahmet, managing to land safely. The Assassin then retrieved the keys while contemplating what to do with Ahmet.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs he did however, Ahmet\'s brother – Selim I – arrived with a platoon of Ottoman guards and Janissaries. Surprised, Ahmet ordered the troops to stand down in the name of the sultan, Bayezid II, though unbeknownst to him, Selim had been named the new Sultan of the Ottoman Empire; Selim then murdered his brother by pushing him off of a nearby cliff. Meeting with Ezio, Selim went on to threaten that Ezio be killed if he returned to Constantinople, sparing him only due to Suleiman\'s good word. As tensions grew between the two men, Ezio\'s rage was only quelled by Sofia, and as Selim left, so too did Ezio and Sofia, heading for Masyaf.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Animus Island one last time, Desmond became witness to the Animus scheduled deletion, seeing everything dissolve in front of him. Clay, knowing full well what was going on, embraced Desmond one last time and then pushed him back into the digital portal, saving him from being deleted by sacrificing himself. Desmond hesitantly left Clay and the Island, and relived the last of Ezio\'s memories.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEzio and Sofia arrived at Masyaf, with Ezio explaining the history of the Assassins and its creed along the way. There, Ezio reflected upon his life and decided to retire after learning the contents of the library, to spend the rest of his time with Sofia. Arriving at the library\'s door, Ezio utilized the five keys and managed to solve the puzzle etched into it, before he made his way inside and soon found the library; void of books, except for the seated remains of Altaïr. His corpse held one last key, where his last major memory was imprinted.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1257, Altaïr had emptied the fortress and had all of his Assassins dispersed. Meeting with Darim one last time, Altaïr ordered him to leave so that the fortress would be empty when the Mongols returned, him staying within the library along with the Apple. Embracing his son one last time, Altaïr locked himself in the library, and then placed the Apple on a pedestal. The Assassin then sat on one of the chairs, holding his last key and imprinted his memory before dying at the age of 92.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter reliving Altaïr\'s final memory, Ezio went to inspect the Mentor\'s Apple of Eden by the pedestal, though he decided it best for the Piece of Eden to stay where it was, before finally laying down his arms as a sign of his retirement. There, the Apple activated, as Ezio called out to Desmond. The Assassin admitted and accepted his existence as a conduit for a message not meant for him, asking Desmond to make the bloodshed in his life mean something. As an apparition of Desmond appeared, Ezio reached out for him, triggering the Synch Nexus.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWithin the Nexus, Desmond met Jupiter. There, the ultimate fate of the First Civilization was revealed: their people had several temples built to study ways on how to save themselves from the coming of a great calamity about to occur. Each temple tried different methods in stopping the event, and had their data subsequently transmitted to the Grand Temple. Despite their efforts, their methods proved to be ineffective, which eventually caused the downfall of their civilization, bringing them to near extinction, as well as humanity. Jupiter then showed the location of the Grand Temple to Desmond, which was in New York. Jupiter, along with Minerva and Juno, entrusted Desmond to stop the coming of the second catastrophe.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter hearing the words of Jupiter, Desmond awoke from his coma, and was greeted by his father, Rebecca, and Shaun. As he stood up, Desmond assured the team of what he needed to do; the team then exited the van and make their way to the Grand Temple.'),

The original plot involved Ezio journeying to the fortress of Masyaf to uncover Altaïr\'s secrets, which Revelations would later adopt. Lost Legacy was quietly canceled, and had been extensively reworked into Revelations.<br><br>Despite Jean-François Boivin releasing a statement that no Assassin\'s Creed game would be released in 2011, Yves Guillemot hinted that there would be \"something Assassin\'s related\" that year.

That same year on 5 May, GameInformer released details and screenshots about the game, such as showing images of an older Ezio Auditore and new weapons like that of the Hookblade.

Ratonhnhaké:ton can go into battle with a wide variety of weapons at his disposal, including two Hidden Blades, a tomahawk, flintlock pistols, rope darts, and a bow and arrow.

Using Ezio\'s Apple of Eden to access the structure, Desmond activates a large portion of the equipment, as well as a timer indicating when the Second Disaster is predicted to occur, on December 21, 2012. His mind then falls into a fugue state, in which he relives some significant memories of his ancestor, Haytham Kenway.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDuring a production at the London Theatre Royal, Haytham murders a man named Miko and steals a medallion which he and his associates believe allows access to a storehouse for \"those who came before\". After Haytham returns with the medallion, he is dispatched to the British American colonies to find the storehouse.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter preventing an attempt by crewman Louis Mills to turn him over to a trailing ship while on board the Providence, Haytham arrives in Boston. There, he is tasked with gathering together five men faithful to his cause: Charles Lee, William Johnson, Thomas Hickey, Benjamin Church and Jonathan Pitcairn. In the process, he kills a slave trader named Silas Thatcher and frees a large group of Kanien\'kehá:ka tribespeople, believing it will make then amicable to his cause.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOne of these Kanien\'kehá:ka, Kaniehtí:io, agrees to help Haytham find the storehouse on the condition that he kill General Edward Braddock, the man responsible for enslaving her people. After tracking his movements, Haytham slays Braddock as he retreats from the battle at Fort Duquesne. Haytham and Kaniehtí:io then travel to the entrance of the Grand Temple, only to find the medallion Haytham possesses cannot open it. At that moment, the pair reveals their romantic feelings for each other, beginning a relationship that will continue for some time.<br><br>\r\n\r\nShortly after, Charles Lee is formally recruited into Haytham\'s organization, the Templar Order. This event surprises Desmond and he ejects himself from the Animus, attempting to absorb this new information. He then engages in a brief fight with his father, saying he is being treated as a pawn, and William strikes him out of anger. Once the tension had eased, Shaun gives Desmond a choice: explore the Grand Temple or return to the Animus.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe story then switches to the point of view of Ratonhnhaké:ton, Kaniehtí:io\'s son by Haytham. After playing hide and seek with his childhood friends in the forest near his village, he encounters Charles Lee and associates, who forcibly inform Ratonhnhaké:ton that they wish to speak with the village elders. Ratonhnhaké:ton is then knocked unconscious, and on his return to the village, he discovers it has been set ablaze. Though he is able to find his mother and attempts to free her from a collapsed structure, he is ultimately unable to save her, and she dies before his eyes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSome years later, a teenage Ratonhnhaké:ton is told by a village elder that the reason no one is allowed to leave the nearby valley is that their purpose is to protect the Grand Temple. She then shows him a crystal-like sphere, which activates at his touch and allows him to communicate with Juno. Juno informs him that he and his village are guardians of the Grand Temple, and current probabilities indicate that unless he leaves, his village will be destroyed and his people slaughtered. After showing the Kanien\'kehá:ka teenager the symbol of the Assassins, she tells him to leave the valley, find Achilles Davenport—an Assassin—and convince the elder, embittered fighter to train him.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter accomplishing this by protecting the Davenport manor from bandits, Ratonhnhaké:ton adopts the name \"Connor\" on Achilles\' suggestion, and the pair set off to collect supplies from Boston. There Haytham attempts to frame his son for the events of the Boston Massacre, leaving Connor notorious in the city. He then meets Samuel Adams, who gives Connor advice on how to decrease his notoriety.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn his return, Achilles presents Connor with the Aquila, a ship he can use to patrol the Eastern American seaboard. As Connor learns the art of being an Assassin, he is brought into the cities of Boston and New York, as well as a large open area, called the Frontier.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter being made a full-fledged member of the Assassin Brotherhood by Achilles, Connor sets out to eliminate the Colonial Templars. William Johnson is assassinated first after he attempts to purchase the land on which Connor\'s people reside. Next, Connor targets John Pitcairn, the leader of the British forces at Bunker and Breed\'s Hills.<br><br>\r\n\r\nConnor then pursues Thomas Hickey, whom he discovers is plotting to assassinate George Washington. Connor finds Hickey, and after a brief scuffle, both are thrown into prison. However, Hickey isn\'t detained for long and is freed through Haytham and Lee\'s influence, while Connor is framed for the plot against Washington and is sentenced to death by hanging. Luckily, Achilles and his fellow Assassins manage to free Connor at the execution. Connor then charges after Hickey and manages to assassinate him before the Templar can kill Washington.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith Haytham, Lee, and Benjamin Church still at large, Connor fears they still plot to eliminate Washington. Connor meets with Washington, who informs him that Church has stolen goods vital to the Continental Army and has fled. Connor agrees to pursue him, and in the process meets his father, Haytham.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHaytham reveals his own pursuit of Church, who has betrayed the Templars as well, and the two agree to set aside their differences and find Church together. Upon traveling to the Caribbean via the Aquila and pursuing Church\'s ship, Haytham and Connor locate Church and kill him, then return to the colonies to meet with Washington.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHere, Haytham discovers a letter from Washington ordering the removal of all the indigenous tribes from the land, as a number of them support the British. One of the tribes to be removed is the Kanien\'kehá:ka, despite their neutrality, and Connor severs his ties with Haytham and Washington as a result. He then takes off to protect his tribe\'s village from encroaching Patriot forces.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn arriving, Connor finds his people to be safe but also discovers that the Clan Mother has dispatched tribesmen to turn back the Continental troops sent to purge the village. Connor stopped his fellows from attacking the troops but is forced to kill his closest childhood friend, Kanen\'tó:kon, who had been influenced by Charles Lee.<br><br>\r\n\r\nConnor becomes torn in his mission to eliminate the Templars, believing he can turn his father to the Assassin way of thinking. He then sets off to pursue Lee, who has been disgraced by Washington and taken refuge in Fort George. With the assistance of Lafayette, Connor has New York harbor shelled to create a distraction and infiltrates the fort. However, he is ambushed by Haytham, who reveals that Lee has escaped with the medallion, and the pair engages in battle. Now accepting that his father will not be convinced, Connor kills Haytham.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs Desmond plays these events out in the Animus, he is occasionally taken out in order to recover power cells crucial to exploring the Grand Temple, found in locations such as Manhattan and Brazil. During these trips, he encounters Daniel Cross, a Templar mole responsible for killing the modern day Mentor and initiating a widespread purge of the Assassin Order.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile exploring the Temple, Desmond occasionally encounters Juno, who reveals the events that led up to the first cataclysm that scarred the Earth. During one of these lectures, Desmond reveals that Lucy\'s death by his hand was no accident and that he chose to kill her after the Apple of Eden revealed she intended to take the Apple to Abstergo Industries.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen a third power cell is located in Cairo, Egypt, William offers to recover it while Desmond continues to search Connor\'s memories for the key to the Grand Temple\'s inner barrier. However, William is captured by Abstergo and held in their Roman facility, the location where Desmond was kept when he was captured and forced to relive Altaïr Ibn-La\'Ahad\'s genetic memories.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThrough a video message, Warren Vidic demands Desmond bring the Apple of Eden to him in exchange for William. In response, Desmond infiltrates the laboratories, where he encounters Daniel again. As Daniel corners Desmond, the Templar begins to suffer from the Bleeding Effect, as a result of being \"raised\" in an Animus and reliving the memories of his ancestors, Nikolai and Innokenti Orelov, for extended periods of time. Daniel then flees from the room in a panic, with Desmond in pursuit. After a short chase, Desmond assassinates Daniel and confronts Vidic in his office, where he uses the Apple to kill the Templar and his guards. Desmond then rescues William and uses the Apple to lead them safely from the facility.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce he returned to the Animus, Desmond observes as Connor pursues Lee once more. After eavesdropping on a ship\'s captain to ascertain Lee\'s location, Connor chases Lee through a vessel under construction that has been set ablaze. The two come to a stalemate after falling through a section of the ship, and Connor is impaled at the waist by a broken piece of wood.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLee asks Connor why he continues to persist, even though the Templar Order follows a cycle of their power waxing and waning. Connor replies \"Because no one else will,\" and shoots Lee in the chest, preventing the Templar from finishing him off. A badly wounded Lee then escapes across a nearby lake via a ferry, with an injured Connor in pursuit. Finally, Connor finds Lee in a pub, and the pair shares a last drink before Connor stabs Lee lethally in the chest.<br><br>\r\n\r\nConnor takes the medallion from Lee\'s body, and several months later, he returns to his tribe\'s village only to find they have moved elsewhere. He then locates the crystal sphere, presumably left behind for him to find. In the vision that it shows him, Juno reappears and instructs him to hide the medallion where no one else will find it. Connor does so, burying the medallion in the grave of Connor Davenport, Achilles\' deceased son and his namesake.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNow with the knowledge of the medallion\'s location, Desmond retrieves it and uses it to access the confines of the Temple. Here, he and the others find Juno\'s apparition, who instructs Desmond to activate a pedestal which will save the world from the ongoing solar flares. However, Minerva\'s apparition suddenly appears and reveals that by doing as Juno says, Desmond will die and free Juno from captivity, allowing her to begin her conquest of the world. She explains that Juno was sealed long ago during the war between the First Civilization and humanity when she plotted to use the machines designed to save the world against it.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMinerva, prodded by Juno, then shows Desmond that if the Sun were to unleash its power on the world, he and a small collective of humans would survive to repopulate the world. He would become a religious icon in this new world, but his words would be mistranslated and lead the world to continue a perpetual cycle of destruction. Believing the world would stand a better chance fighting against Juno, Desmond instructs the others to leave and prepare for the oncoming struggle. Desmond then activates the pedestal, taking his life and saving the world. From there, Juno appears and tells Desmond that his part has ended and that her time has come.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn an epilogue, Connor takes down the Templar portraits in the Davenport Manor\'s basement and burns them, signifying the end of his journey. In addition, his return to his village is detailed further, showing he spoke to a hunter there, who revealed that the land had been sold to settlers in order to settle the new United States government\'s war debts. Connor also travels to the pier in New York, where he witnesses the last of the British Regulars leave America for good. However, he also sees evidence of the slave trade present in the newly formed nation, right next to the pier of citizens cheering at the departure of the British.<br><br>'),

He considered beginning the story with Edward as a boy during William Kidd and Henry Morgan\'s era of piracy, but decided he felt skeptical as to whether Assassin\'s Creed II convincingly portrayed a similar span of time, and so opted to simply focus on the Blackbeard era towards the end of the Golden Age of Piracy.<br><br>McDevitt stated the game\'s primary history resources were Captain Charles Johnson\'s A General History of the Pyrates (1724) and Colin Woodard\'s The Republic of Pirates (2008).

(35, 6, 'Gameplay', '<h4>Locations and navigation</h4>About 60% of the game takes place on land; players can explore 50 locations ranging from fisherman villages, plantations, jungles, forts, islands, Templar hideouts, Maya ruins and exotic Coconut Islands. Furthermore, there are around 75 beaches and sandbanks, which can hold various treasures and marooned sailors to add to Edward\'s crew.<br><br>Other activities include hunting, harpooning, and exploring underwater environments. The game aims to blend between its land and aquatic experiences seamlessly, to the point where players can simply dive off Edward\'s ship, swim to the shore and explore the land, as well as dive under the surface to loot underwater ship wrecks.<br><br>Viewpoints are also in Black Flag. As in the previous games, viewpoints have to be synchronized so as to reveal information about an area and its surroundings. Furthermore, they now also serve the function of fast-travel locations. Synchronizing with a viewpoint unlocks more loot and area of \"interest\" to Edward and can also be used as a faster way of locating a specific target.<br><br><h4>Combat</h4>Black Flag\'s combat has been upgraded to include free aiming. While previous installments relied on the game\'s built-in auto aim, in Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag, players are able to just aim and fire, similar to third-person shooters.<br><br>Dual-wielding weapons has also been implemented, with Edward being able to carry four flintlock pistols and be able to use them all together, chaining up to four gunshots into a combo of attacks to take down more enemies. Aside from the pistols and his Hidden Blades, Edward can equip dual cutlass swords and chain their attacks together. Other weapons include a blowpipe with multiple effected projectiles and rope darts. Accompanying this, the stealth system has been remade and is encouraged in-game.<br><br>Combo attacks are achieved through chaining multiple attacks in a row while uninterrupted. The game includes many different ways of combo moves, with some available through running towards an enemy or jumping onto an enemy from the high ground.<br><br><h4>Naval combat</h4>The game also includes naval combat, with 40% of the story taking place on the water, which includes numerous side missions. After checking out a ship with Edward\'s spyglass from the Jackdaw\'s crow\'s nest and evaluating the information and statistics, players can launch an attack using various scenarios; one can simply shoot the opposing captain, board the ship by leaping from mast-to-mast and performing an air assassination, or charge into the fray to cut down foes using Edward\'s swords. Once the objectives for each boarding process, all of which include killing a certain amount of soldiers, are completed, the player has three options - reduce the Jackdaw\'s notoriety, send the ship to Edward\'s fleet, or salvage the ship to repair the Jackdaw. Players are also able to exploit weather patterns, luring the opposition into less than ideal conditions, such as rogue waves, to their advantage. Naval combat also features a trajectory-based aiming system that requires knowledge of distance and the speed of an enemy.<br><br><h4>Upgrades</h4>Players are also able to upgrade Edward Kenway\'s Jackdaw through pillaging, taking over enemy ships, and completing missions, granting the Jackdaw new weapons and abilities. Of these, weapon upgrades include round shot, heavy shot, chain shot, fire barrels, mortars, swivel guns, and a ram. Edward can recruit crew members for the Jackdaw via side missions that include bar fights and battle missions. It is also possible to simply rescue them while just sailing across the map. However, the crew members are also expected to die in the game while braving storms and boarding enemy ships, forcing Edward to continuously recruit more members. The game also has six different enemy archetypes at sea that all behave in vastly different ways and require the player to have different upgrades to deal with them.<br><br><h4>Memories</h4>Instead of Desmond Miles, the modern day portion is centered around the players themselves, who act as Abstergo Entertainment research analysts that are reliving the memories of Edward Kenway. The Animus no longer constrains the players with its barriers whenever they attempt to interact with an environment the ancestor has not; instead tougher enemy ships will block the way, with the only way around them being to actually explore the world, and finding things that can go towards upgrading the Jackdaw. In addition, players are able to connect with other players in the modern day, which will allow them to interact and share information with each other.<br><br><h4>Other</h4>Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag includes many historical figures such as Benjamin Hornigold, Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny, Charles Vane, and Edward Thatch.<br><br>The notoriety system featured in previous Assassin\'s Creed games was remade in Black Flag, as a \"worldwide alert\" for a pirate sailing between islands was deemed illogical. In its place, a system of pirate hunters were introduced, with four tiers of increasingly difficult ships appearing to attack the Jackdaw depending on how many robberies Edward has committed.<br><br>The new \"Horizon\" open-world system dynamically creates side missions, such as merchant ships to rob, whales to hunt, or pirates to rescue, dependent on an individual\'s playing style.<br><br>Edward will put his hood on when in a restricted zone or in a city, and take it off when on the open seas or as soon as he is incognito.<br><br><h4>Multiplayer</h4>The multiplayer aspect of Black Flag includes cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, some of which that are reused from previous games, along with all new maps and new characters.'),
(36, 6, 'Plot', 'Using the DNA collected from Desmond Miles’s corpse, Abstergo Entertainment developed an initiative called the Sample 17 Project to explore the genetic memories of Desmond’s ancestors to gather material for the production of various Animus Omega products and feature films. The project was started with the ulterior motive of locating various Precursor sites and Pieces of Eden. In 2013, the company hired a research analyst for scouting the memories of one of Desmond’s ancestors, Edward Kenway, a British privateer-turned pirate who later went on to become an Assassin.<br><br>After an attack on the ship he was aboard, Edward found himself stranded on a deserted island with an Assassin. The man ran off into the jungle, after which Kenway chased him down and killed him. Among his possessions, he found a letter addressed to Duncan Walpole, from the Governor of Cuba, Laureano de Torres y Ayala, promising him a reward for some maps he was carrying. Edward donned Walpole\'s robes, heard shots in the distance, and proceeded to investigate, leading him to a ship with its crew being held by British soldiers. Edward killed the soldiers and rescued a merchant named Stede Bonnet, later accompanying him to Havana.<br><br>Having arrived in Havana, Edward, still posing as Walpole, met with Governor Torres and his associates, hoping to claim his reward. Edward learned of the existence of the Templar Order and a Precursor site known as the Observatory, with the power of locate and monitor every person on Earth with a vial of blood. According to the old tales, the blood of a Sage is required to enter the Observatory. Afterwards, Edward was inducted in the Templar Order.<br><br>Edward met with the Templars at the docks in the next morning to meet a Sage named Bartholomew Roberts and escort him to the governor\'s mansion. During the journey to Torres\' mansion, the group was attacked by Assassins, allowing the Sage to escape. Edward fought the Assassins and managed to capture the Sage. He later claimed his promised reward, but was unhappy with its quantity. Edward decided to free the Sage and find out more about the Observatory, hoping to make more money. However, as he snuck into Torres\' mansion, he found his cell empty and scattered with dead bodies. While investigating the area, Edward was knocked out and identified as an imposter by the Templars. He was taken prisoner and locked up on one of the ships of the Spanish Treasure Fleet.<br><br>Edward awoke to find himself in leg irons together with a fellow prisoner, Adéwalé. After freeing themselves, the men rescued the fleet\'s prisoners and stole a brig, which Edward decided to keep afterwards. He named his new ship the Jackdaw and made Adéwalé his quartermaster. Following this, the pirate set course for Nassau. After assembling a crew, he met with Edward Thatch and Benjamin Hornigold, who took Edward out to sea to teach him how to plunder ships. He then met with James Kidd, and devised a plan to rob a plantation. Edward and Thatch set out to acquire a galleon for Nassau\'s defense. The pirate assassinated its captain, the Templar Julien du Casse, and claimed his vessel for Nassau\'s defense and his island for himself.<br><br>While exploring Edward’s memories, the analyst was enlisted by IT head John Standish to hack computers, Animi, security cameras, and servers around Abstergo Entertainment\'s Montreal facility in order to obtain information on Abstergo\'s actions for the Assassins, and pass it on to Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings, who routinely collected it at Shaun\'s coffee stand in the building\'s lobby, though the analyst wasn’t originally aware of this.<br><br>A few weeks later, Edward set course for Tulum, looking for Kidd, who was expecting him in the Assassin hideout. Upon Mentor Ah Tabai’s behest, Edward navigated a Mayan ruin to identify the return of a Sage. Upon confirming Roberts’ identity, Edward and Kidd exited the Mayan ruin to discover both the Assassins and the Jackdaw\'s crew held hostage by slave traders. Edward freed the Assassins and his crew members. Ah Tabai absolved Edward of the deaths of his fellow Assassins in Havana, but exiled him from Tulum.<br><br>Edward devised a plan to find Roberts and earn some money by using Torres as bait. He set out to Kingston, where he planned to tail Torres and Laurens Prins, hoping to find the Sage. He found Kidd trying to assassinate both men and stopped him, allowing them to escape. Edward then prepared to assassinate Prins after having promised Kidd he would do so. Suddenly, Kidd removed his bandana and reddened his lips with his blood, revealing himself to be a woman named Mary Read. Edward found Prins and assassinated him, but Roberts appeared, holding Mary hostage. The Sage managed to escape once again.<br><br>While staying in Nassau, Edward witnessed the arrival of the Royal Navy and Woodes Rogers, who came to offer the King\'s pardon to all pirates, and Hornigold and his men decided to accept it. They also lifted a naval block around Nassau, preventing the pirates from leaving. After learning that Commodore Peter Chamberlaine planned to destroy all the pirate ships in Nassau\'s harbor, Edward assassinated him and escaped Nassau with Charles Vane.<br><br>Edward sailed north to meet with Thatch. During a confront with the Royal Navy, Thatch was killed, and Edward barely managed to escape. He also learned of a ship called the Princess, aboard which he could find the Sage. Edward and Vane went after a slave ship to find information about the Princess, but due to Jack Rackham\'s mutiny, they were stranded on Isla Providencia. Edward was forced to deal with an insane Charles Vane, and managed to leave the island on a ship that had arrived.<br><br>After retrieving his ship and crew from Rackham, Edward traveled to Kingston to learn more about the Sage\'s location. Edward located Hornigold and Rogers, who met with Torres. Through them, Edward learned that Bartholomew Roberts could be found on the island of Príncipe. He traveled to Príncipe, in order to find Roberts. During his search, Edward assassinated Josiah Burgess and John Cockram, freeing pirates from a Portuguese camp along the way. With that, Edward finally gained the trust of Roberts, who in turn requested his aid. Edward met with Roberts to claim a set of vials from a Portuguese fleet. They managed to acquire the blood vials, and Edward was promised a chance to enter the Observatory.<br><br>When meeting up with Roberts again, Edward was directed to assassinate Hornigold, who had tailed him. Edward informed Adéwalé of his plan of selling the Observatory for the highest price. Adéwalé suggested inform the Assassins instead, so they could protect it, but Edward refused. Edward arrived at the Observatory, but was betrayed by Roberts and imprisoned in Port Royal.<br><br>Eventually, the hacking activity was discovered at the same time that the company\'s Chief Creative Officer, Olivier Garneau, went missing. In response, Olivier\'s stand-in, Melanie Lemay, reluctantly imprisoned the analyst and several other employees in bunkers in the basement, where they would continue their work until the hacker could be identified. Subsequently, John raised the analyst\'s security clearance so that they could leave their bunker, and instructed them to hack the main server in order to cover their tracks. Unbeknownst to the analyst, following John\'s instructions activated a program designed to transfer Juno\'s consciousness into another body; unfortunately, Juno was not yet strong enough to maintain a physical form, and this aspect of the plan failed, much to John’s rage. The analyst then resumed exploring Edward’s memories.<br><br>Edward was led into the trial of Mary Read and Anne Bonny. They warn that they’re pregnant, so their executions are postponed. Four months after the trial, Edward was locked in one of Port Royal\'s gibbets. Ah Tabai freed Edward, returned his weapons and requested his aid to free Mary and Anne. Along the way, Edward found Jack Rackham\'s skeletal corpse in a gibbet and a delirious Charles Vane in a cell. In a nearby cell, Anne shouted for help from the guards, because Mary’s gotten ill after childbirth. Edward helped Mary to reach outside, but she passed away.<br><br>After suffering the loss of Mary, Edward tried to drown his sorrows, which resulted in a disturbing dream. Adéwalé woke Edward up on the beach afterwards. Edward then set sail for Tulum to meet with the Assassins and make amends. After aiding the Assassins with a Spanish invasion, Edward earned their trust.<br><br>Edward, now allied with the Assassins, set out to Kingston to assassinate Rogers. Then Edward sailed to Principe to kill Roberts. He attempted to assassinate Torres in Havana, but found his victim to be a decoy, El Tiburón. He killed him and set out for the Observatory, where Torres would be. Edward began to make his way towards the Observatory, freeing its guardians as he came across them and killing the Spanish soldiers. Edward found and assassinated Torres, returned the Observatory to its dormant state, and received a letter, learned of his wife\'s passing.<br><br>John then entered the analyst\'s bunker while they were using the Animus and revealed himself to be a Sage, a reincarnation of Aita. He attempted to poison the analyst, weakening them enough that their body could host Juno. However, he was shortly caught and killed by Abstergo\'s security guards. The analyst later woke in Melanie\'s office, where she apologized for imprisoning them. She claimed that while she originally believed them to be the hacker, information recovered from John\'s computer proved that he was responsible. After Melanie revealed the completed trailer for Devils of the Caribbean as a token of good will, the analyst was allowed to return to work.<br><br>Edward met with Ah Tabai and Adéwalé at Great Inagua, awaiting the arrival of his daughter. He passed on his manor on Great Inagua to the Assassins for their new base, and met his daughter, Jennifer Scott, for the first time. Edward then sailed to England with Jennifer. Sometime later, Edward remarried and conceived a son, Haytham Kenway. The post-credits scene shows Edward, Jennifer and Haytham attending The Beggar\'s Opera at the Theatre Royal.'),

(41, 7, 'Gameplay', 'With the historical Seven Years\' War having almost the same level of European naval activity as the Golden Age of Piracy, if not more due to the unmatched power of England\'s Royal Navy, Rogue appropriately incorporates the naval element previously established in Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag and Freedom Cry. Through Shay, the player controls his ship, the modified sloop-of-war Morrigan. Being smaller than Edward Kenway\'s brig Jackdaw, it can easily navigate the tight bays of the Hudson River Valley and the iceberg-heavy regions in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.<br><br>The primary locations in the game are New York City, the Hudson River Valley, and the North Atlantic, specifically, the area around Newfoundland and Nova Scotia known as the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The North Atlantic is an icy water-based region, where icebergs can be used as cover during naval combat, as well as broken to reveal frozen cargo and Animus data fragments. With the help of an ice-breaker ram, navigation is supplemented and additional secret areas can be reached. Meanwhile, the River Valley is a hybrid of land-based and naval gameplay, with seamless river navigation integrated into a map reminiscent of the Frontier from Assassin\'s Creed III. New York is also bigger than its first appearance in Assassin\'s Creed III, as it is 20 years before the Revolution and so the Great Fire of 1776 has not happened yet. All together, the three regions require more exploration than all of Black Flag.<br><br>Environmental hazards have been incorporated in the form of poison gas barrels, which when burst open can drive victims berserk if within the expanding radius of fumes; Shay can avoid being affected by pulling a gas mask over his face. Accompanying this, swimming in the freezing waters of the North Atlantic damages Shay\'s health, so underwater sections like those in Black Flag were removed entirely.<br><br>Joining the Templars grants Shay considerably different weapons from earlier installments, both ship-based and personal. Being extremely well-financed, the Templars have access to actual and prototype weapons that would usually be restricted to the military. Aboard the Morrigan, two mounted Puckle guns replace the swivel gun. Early machine guns, they have a greater shot capacity than the 5-shot swivels, and a greater rate of fire, with the chamber reloading semi-automatically instead of through single-shot. Oil barrels replace the exploding barrels in Black Flag.<br><br>New to the player\'s arsenal is the air rifle, a ranged weapon that used compressed air to fire various projectiles and silently eliminate enemies. Like a blowpipe, it could fire sleep and poison darts, but it could also shoot firecrackers for distractions, while a grenade launcher attachment allowed it to fire such ammunition like gas bombs or shrapnel grenades. Besides being chosen for its impressive capabilities, the air rifle\'s silence in delivering its payloads was meant to reflect the Templars\' equally silent behind-the-scenes manipulations.<br><br>However, having switched his allegiances in the secretive Assassin-Templar War, Shay is now a constant target to the very missions the player performed in past games. During naval battles, the Morrigan can be rammed by enemy ships, forcing Shay and his crew to protect the vessel from Assassin-affiliated attackers. Land travel poses perhaps the greatest risk, with all hiding spots potentially concealing stalkers. Accordingly, some mechanics from past multiplayer segments have been incorporated, such as a compass indicating a target\'s position being a part of Eagle Vision, and whispers increasing in volume to indicate the presence of nearby hidden assailants. In place of assassination contracts are Assassin Interception missions, in which Shay must intercept the contract on a carrier pigeon, and then subsequently find and defend the intended target from the Assassin\'s gang.<br><br>The ability to kill civilians and domestic animals with melee weapons returns, with the desynchronization penalty applying to Shay only during his time as an Assassin. Upon leaving the Brotherhood, bounty hunters will be sent after Shay for killing civilians, similar to pirate hunters in Black Flag. Sea shanties make a return, though Producer Karl van der Luhe confirmed that all the explicitly pirate-themed songs had replaced with Irish- and New York-themed ones, given Shay\'s heritage and upbringing. Another continued feature was hunting, with new animals unique to the Arctic regions, such as narwhals and polar bears. With new animal resources comes new items and upgrades for crafting. White whales are also fully included and are not community events.<br><br>Characters seen previously in the Kenway saga make appearances, such as Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Haytham Kenway, William Johnson, and Achilles Davenport from Assassin\'s Creed III, as well as Adéwalé from Black Flag. Brief appearances are made by Charles Dorian, his son, Arno, and Élise de la Serre from Assassin\'s Creed: Unity, while François Mackandal, Edward Kenway, and Ratonhnhaké:ton are mentioned in some modern day segments narrated by Juhani Otso Berg.'),

With the help of Benjamin Franklin, a Piece of Eden is located in Lisbon, and Cormac is tasked with retrieving it.<br><br>However, during the course of his task, Shay has gradually begun to question the Assassins\' motives and disagrees with their refusal to engage in dialogue with the Templars. His doubts come to a head in Lisbon, where his attempt to retrieve the Piece of Eden from the underground Seismic Temple triggers an earthquake which destroys the city. Knowing that a similar event involving the same type of artifact occurred in Haiti and almost mad with guilt, Shay assumes that Achilles and the other Assassins knew the consequences of such an action from the beginning. Once back to the Davenport Homestead, he confronts his superiors about the events he had witnessed; however, his aggressive behavior and his uncontrollable anger lead to further misunderstandings. Taking the Assassin\'s reluctance as a refusal to believe him, Cormac steals a manuscript necessary to interpret the artifact and attempts to flee. Ultimately, the chase ends with a confrontation on the edge of a cliff at the homestead, where he decides to commit suicide rather than having the Assassins take back the Manuscript. Just as he jumps, Louis-Joseph Gaultier, Chevalier de la Vérendrye shoots him in the back, although Shay survives and mistakenly believes that it was his best friend, Liam O\'Brien.<br><br>Cormac is rescued by a passing ship and taken to New York City, where he recovers and devotes his time to driving out the city\'s criminal gangs. His actions attract the attention of Colonel George Monro, the city\'s governor, who offers Cormac the chance to help rebuild the city. Shay accepts and then goes on assisting the British Army in their early campaigns against the French. Monro reveals himself to be a Templar, and while aware of Cormac\'s previous loyalties, he offers him a place within the Order\'s Colonial Rite. Cormac accepts in the aftermath of the Siege of Fort William Henry, where he sought to defend Monro and his remaining soldiers from an attack lead by Kesegowaase, one of Cormac\'s former tutors. Although Shay killed Kesegowaase, Monro perished under Liam\'s hand. Shortly afterwards, Shay is formally inducted to the Templar Order by the Grand Master Haytham Kenway.<br><br>Cormac tells Kenway that he believes that the Pieces of Eden sought by the Assassins are not weapons but structures to hold the world together, and pledges to stop his former allies before they cause another catastrophe. To Shay\'s temporary regret, one of his victims is Adéwalé, former quartermaster of Edward Kenway\'s Jackdaw. After killing Hope Jensen, head of New York\'s Assassin network, Shay finds out that the Assassins are headed to the Arctic, where another Precursor temple has been located.<br><br>Shay and Haytham race north and confront Achilles and Liam over their actions, even as Achilles admit his mistake about the Piece of Eden\'s power. In an attempt to diffuse a tense standoff and prevent bloodshed, Achilles pushes Liam away from Shay but towards the Piece of Eden, inadvertently causing its destruction and triggering another earthquake. While Haytham pursues Achilles outside, Shay and Liam fight throughout the temple until a high ice ledge breaks and they fall, with the impact mortally wounding Liam. With his last breath, Liam questions whether Shay\'s actions would get his desired results. Cormac leaves the ice cavern and returns to the shore in time to persuade Haytham to spare Achilles, as his testimony will stop the Assassins from trying to locate other Precursor sites. Haytham agrees, but nonetheless cripples Achilles as a precaution by shooting him in the knee.<br><br>With the Colonial Assassin Brotherhood all but destroyed, Cormac is tasked with locating the box used to find the Pieces of Eden, as Achilles had passed it to other Assassins prior to his Arctic voyage. Cormac\'s twenty year search eventually leads him to the Palace of Versailles, where he discovers the box under the care of a French Assassin named Charles Dorian. Cormac kills Dorian and takes possession of the box, taunting the dying man with the promise that although the American Revolution ended Templar influence in the New World, the advent of a new revolution may yet hold promise.<br><br>In the present day, Numbskull reconciles Cormac\'s memories. Under the direction of Master Templar Juhani Otso Berg, they upload them to the Assassin network, revealing how close Achilles Davenport came to destroying the world. The result is almost instantaneous, with the Assassins thrown into visible disarray before abruptly severing communication. As reward for their actions, Numbskull is presented with a choice to join the Templar Order, or die, with the game fading to black before a decision is made.');

(43, 7, 'Development', 'The first details on Rogue came in March 2014, when news leaked that Ubisoft planned to release two games that Fall, one of which was code-named \"Assassin\'s Creed: Comet\" and was to be released exclusively for PS3 and Xbox 360. Another leak at month\'s end revealed Comet\'s protagonist was a Templar named Shay, and that the majority of the story was set in New York City and the North Atlantic around 1758. The report also stated that since Comet bridged the gap between Black Flag and Assassin\'s Creed III, gameplay would be an appropriate hybrid and characters from previous series entries would make appearances, with Haytham Kenway and Adéwalé rumored to return.<br><br>Following a final leak in August 2014, this time of the cinematic trailer, Ubisoft confirmed the existence of the game and officially announced the upcoming title, Assassin\'s Creed: Rogue, which was developed by Ubisoft Sofia in collaboration with the studios in Bucharest, Chengdu, Singapore, Montreal, Quebec, and Milan.<br><br>In an interview with Game Informer, Rogue\'s Narrative Designer Richard Farrese said that the idea of a game with a Templar protagonist had been discussed among the brand team for some while, but the right opportunity had never presented itself, elaborating:<br><br><i>We have so many good characters and come of them we just want to use again. One of the reasons we actually picked this time period </i>[the Seven Years\' War]<i> is that the characters that were created, they\'re so rich that we felt that there were more stories to tell.</i><br><br>It was only after the release of Assassin\'s Creed III and Black Flag that Brand Content Manager Jean Guesdon felt the development team had the resources to complete the saga in the New World by using the past research and game mechanics. Guesdon also wanted a chance to portray a more layered Templar who actually believed in and fought for a cause after so many games from the Assassin perspective depicting them as \"basic, monolithic villains\", especially after reactions to Haytham in Assassin\'s Creed III and Assassin\'s Creed: Forsaken. Due to the advertised connection between Unity and Rogue, Unity\'s development team allowed the Rogue team to create a mission in a parsed-down model of the Parisian streets and the Palace of Versailles. In spite of the plot tie-in, Guesdon was confident Rogue could still operate by itself as a standalone for newcomers to the series.<br><br>Not only did the producers want to approach Rogue from the opposite side of the Assassin-Templar War ideology, but also for players to become invested in Shay\'s story. When asked about Shay\'s about-face, Producer Karl van der Luhe responded, \"It\'s not a case of I\'m going to the dark side. It\'s a case of I\'m more aligned with their approach.\" Even though Shay would confront and sometimes have to kill former allies, explained Producer Ivan Balabanov, killing them would not come easily and would have an emotional cost, with the ultimate goal of having the players question everything they thought they knew about how both factions were represented. Related to this, the producers added, while the addition or omission of certain characters from Black Flag and Assassin\'s Creed III was primarily based on the timeline, of greater importance to properly tell Rogue\'s story was whether they would be worthy opponents to test Shay\'s convictions on joining the Templars, and so garner emotional reactions from both Shay and players.<br><br>Farrese was not alone in writing Rogue, having help from scriptwriters Susan Patrick, who assisted with the main story, and James Nadiger, who covered the modern day segments, the collectibles and the war letters. The most challenging part of writing Rogue, said Patrick, was its niche production date. The events of Black Flag and Assassin\'s Creed III had to be considered, but the tie-in with Unity also had to be kept in mind. Another challenge was giving the game a pro-Templar view, highlighting the Templars\' positive attributes like order, while presenting valid criticisms of the Assassins\' methods.<br><br>For Nadiger, writing Otso Berg allowed him and players to see how Templars viewed their own Order\'s figureheads, adding that it was interesting how much of a historian Berg was considering his prominence in the field as a member of Sigma Team, a characterization that continued into the Assassin\'s Creed: Reflections comic miniseries. In his view, creating the easter eggs in the war letters and elsewhere was important, as they helped ease the progression from and connections between Black Flag and Rogue, but also set up in-universe \"future\" events in Assassin\'s Creed III, Assassin\'s Creed III: Liberation, and Unity. Giving an example, he mentioned how the student-teacher connection between Achilles and Ah Tabai came about through talks with Assassin\'s Creed III\'s production team.<br><br>Although New York features heavily in Rogue, it was critical to Rogue\'s Art Director Eddie Bennun that the concept art not use the same color palette as Assassin\'s Creed III. The art team followed Raphael Lacoste\'s example, looking into landscape pieces by Albert Bierstadt and Aldro Hibbard in order to get a feel for the brighter atmosphere of the times. The intent was to depict New York not just as the bustling city from Assassin\'s Creed III, but as \"the true New World\'s business and industrial center\". Likewise, concept art for the River Valley mainly used bright \"organic shapes and composition\" to reflect the Valley\'s gentle, rolling topography that is dotted with small trading posts, forts, and Indigenous settlements.<br><br>Shay\'s wardrobe also underwent artistic changes reflecting his changed ideology, from the visually flowing Assassin robes to the regimented, angular Templar coat. The Morrigan\'s weaponry was not immune either, being just as affected by Shay\'s Templar leaning, with the Ubisoft Sofia developers revealing that the bluntness and power of the icebreaker ram, the burning oil barrels, and by extension all other armaments acquired after changing sides, had been planned from the onset as part of the greater Templar mindset written across all aspects of the game.'),

The memory takes place in 13 October 1307, in the Temple in Paris, which was being attacked by the forces of King Philip the Fair. Alerted by the ensuing battle, Jacques tasked his advisor to hide the Sword of Eden and the Codex Pater Intellectus. Running through the battlefield, the advisor took notice of an Assassin, Thomas de Carneillon. After a sword fight with Thomas, the advisor returned the Sword and Codex to their resting place in the Temple. As the advisor left the room, he noticed Jacques had been captured. However, before he could rescue the Grand Master, the advisor was stopped by Thomas, who killed him with his Hidden Blade. Seven years later, Jacques and his affiliates were set to be burned at the stake. Before perishing, Jacques cursed the Pope and King overseeing his execution. With his death, the Templar Order was publicly disbanded.<br><br>Suddenly, the memory was interrupted by the transmission of an Assassin, who introduced herself as Bishop.

While waiting for his father on a chair, Arno saw a girl running away, and followed her. After Arno stole an apple for her, the girl introduced herself as Élise de la Serre. Suddenly, a commotion was heard. Arno followed the crowd and found his father\'s body laid on the floor. Charles Dorian was assassinated, leaving his son an orphan under the care of Templar Grand Master François de la Serre.<br><br>Thirteen years later, Arno was at De la Serre estate performing chores when De la Serre left in a carriage. Then, an exhausted Templar messenger, Perrault, caught up to Arno, having a letter needed to be urgently delivered to De la Serre. Arno took the letter and chased after the carriage, but failed to deliver the message to François de la Serre.<br><br>Arno then learned of a party at the Palace of Versailles where Élise was. After sliding the letter under De la Serre\'s office’s door. Arno put on a suit and infiltrated the Palace to find Élise. After sharing a romantic moment with her, Arno and Élise were then interrupted by a guard, and Élise told Arno to leave. On his way out, Arno spotted De la Serre, who fell to the ground, dead. Charles Gabriel Sivert came from behind a wall and then framed Arno for the murder. Arno was taken by the guards and subsequently imprisoned in the Bastille.<br><br>Arno found himself in a cell with four other men. After his first night in prison, he saw one of the prisoners holding his father’s watch, and tried to take it back. The prisoner handed Arno a wooden training sword, and the two dueled. Arno called his attention to a wall painted with unusual symbols. The prisoner acknowledged Arno’s Eagle Vision, and after learning his surname, introduced himself as Pierre Bellec, revealing that his late father was an Assassin before returning the watch and offering to train Arno.<br><br>Two months later, Bellec and Arno were still training, while a great commotion was taking place outside. The Bastille was stormed by revolutionaries, and Bellec and Arno took the opportunity to escape. Days later, he made his way to the de la Serre estate in search of Élise, who assumed he was responsible for her father\'s death. Élise handed Arno the letter he was supposed to deliver to her father, warning him of betrayal from someone within the Templar Order. After learning about his unwitting role in his stepfather\'s death, Arno decided to seek out the Assassin Brotherhood. After finding Bellec and meeting the Assassin Council, Arno was inducted into the Parisian Brotherhood of Assassins.<br><br>Bishop then showed up and offered the user a chance to join the Assassins. Once they accepted, Bishop showed them footage of Abstergo\'s Phoenix Project, explaining that the Templars were searching for Sages both in the present and the past to map the Precursor genome. As Arno had encountered a Sage at some point during his lifetime, Bishop was hoping to have the Initiate find the Sage\'s remains before Abstergo, through Arno\'s memories. Bishop then allowed the Initiate to proceed.<br><br>Arno rendezvoused with Bellec on a rooftop near the Conciergerie for his last exercise before becoming a fully fledged Assassin, where he learned that Sivert would be at Notre-Dame the next day. Arno was tasked with finding and assassinating Sivert. Arno infiltrated the church entered the confessional, impersonating Sivert’s accomplice, Duchesneau, in order to gain information from Sivert. Having gained the necessary information, Arno thrust his arm through the lattice and stabbed Sivert in the throat with his Hidden Blade, killing the Templar. Arno then viewed Sivert\'s memories, and learned the identity of his partner-in-crime on the night of De la Serre\'s murder, the Roi des Thunes.<br><br>Arno informed the Assassin Council of his discovery, where he was given the Phantom Blade and tasked with finding and assassinating the Roi des Thunes. Arno left for the Cour des Miracles and investigated a commotion, where he found a beggar having his foot forcibly amputated by the Roi des Thunes\' lieutenant, Aloys la Touche. Just as he was about to intervene, Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, advised him against it, suggesting instead that Arno followed La Touche to his master. Arno found and interrogated him, discovering the hiding place of the Roi des Thunes. Arno entered the sewers and started making his way towards the Roi des Thunes. Arno managed to assassinate his target, and with the Roi des Thunes dead, De Sade took over his position immediately. He then informed Arno that François-Thomas Germain had crafted the pin used to kill François de la Serre.<br><br>The Council tasked Arno with investigating the silversmith, Germain. Arno infiltrated the workshop and found Germain, who claimed being held against his will for months. Arno escorted Germain outside, who retributed telling Arno that he made the pin for a man called Chrétien Lafrenière. While investigating Lafrenière, Arno destroyed his gunpowder supply and discovered where to find his target. Arno arrived at the Holy Innocents\' Cemetery to assassinate Lafrenière, the man he believed to be responsible for François de la Serre\'s death. Arno assassinated Lafrenière and, through his memories, he discovered that Lafrenière was planning to attack the Hôtel de Beauvais in force.<br><br>Arno returned to the Council, and informed them of Lafrenière’s involvement in De la Serre’s murder. The Council tasked Arno with finding and assassinating Lafrenière, but he informed them that he already did, much to their indignation. Although initially scolded for his assassination of Lafrenière, Arno was allowed to continue his investigation. Arno reached the Hôtel de Beauvais. By eavesdropping on a Templar meeting, he learned of a planned ambush on Élise. Arno reunited with Élise and rescued her from the Templar ambush. He then instructed her to meet him at the Café Théâtre.<br><br>Arno met with Élise at the Café Théâtre and convinced her to join forces with the Brotherhood to find her father\'s killer. Élise was brought before the Assassin Council, although she was unable to land an agreement with them. While Mirabeau convened with the Council, Arno informed her of Germain. Élise informed Arno that Germain was exiled from the Templar Order for his radical views and heretical notions about Jacques de Molay. Investigating Germain\'s residence, they discovered him to be her father\'s killer. While planning to inform Mirabeau of Germain\'s true identity, Arno and Élise found him murdered. After an investigation, they deduced that the killer was likely an Assassin. Arno followed a lead to the Sainte-Chapelle, and discovered Mirabeau\'s killer to be Bellec. He had done this because he strongly believed that no peace could be achieved between the Assassins and the Templars, and that purging the Brotherhood to remake it into a stronger organization was a good thing. Bellec attempted to convince Arno to join his cause, but Arno refused, and forced into a duel, Arno reluctantly killed his former mentor.<br><br>Arno met with the Assassin Council for his next assignment. The Council learned that Mirabeau was in contact with the King and tasks Arno to find the letters he sent before they’re made public. Arno infiltrated the Tuileries Palace, and while disposing of Mirabeau\'s correspondence with the King Louis, Arno met artillery officer Napoleon Bonaparte. After escaping the Tuileries with him, Arno was able to gain his assistance in tracking down Captain Frédéric Rouille. Arno reached the Grand Châtelet, where Rouille and his men were executing prisoners. Arno tracked down and assassinated Rouille. Through his memories, he learned of a Templar plot to starve France and incite riots, led by a woman named Marie Lévesque.<br><br>Arno met with Élise at Le Marais, and informed her of Lévesque’s plan. Stealing a set of orders from the captain of a grain barge, he discovered that Lévesque would be at the Luxembourg Palace. Arno infiltrated the Palace and assassinated Lévesque. Through her memories, he learned of a plot to execute King Louis, undertaken by Louis-Michel le Peletier. Arno and Élise escaped the area in a hot air balloon. They then shared a night of passion.<br><br>Seeking to find and kill Le Peletier, Arno and Élise met with the Marquis de Sade at the Louvre, who informed them that Le Peletier could be found at the Palais-Royal. Arno tracked down and assassinated Le Peletier. Through his memories, he learned that Germain would be present at King Louis\' execution the following morning.<br><br>At King Louis\' execution, Arno met with Élise near the Place de la Révolution, intending to assassinate Germain. Louis XVI was executed, and Arno failed to assassinate Germain since he refused to let Élise take on the Grand Master\'s bodyguards alone. This caused her to question his devotion to avenging her father. As a result, she cut off contact with Arno.<br><br>As Arno returned to the Assassin hideout, he was stopped by two Assassins and escorted to the Council. Due to Arno defying orders to abandon Germain’s investigation and his obsession for revenge, the Council expelled Arno from the Brotherhood. Months later, he had moved back to the De la Serre estate in Versailles and returned drinking. While attempting to find his missing watch, Élise found him and convinced him to resume their mission.<br><br>As Aloys la Touche hosted executions at the town square, Arno set out to rid Versailles of his terror over the town. Arno assassinated la Touche and, through his memories, he learned that Maximilien de Robespierre, leader of the Reign of Terror, was Germain\'s final conspirator.<br><br>Arno and Élise drove back to Paris, seeking to find Germain through Robespierre at the Festival of the Supreme Being. They managed to plant incriminating evidence on several people, discrediting Robespierre and turning popular opinion against him. Once Germain abandoned him, it would be easy to acquire information from Robespierre. Robespierre was arrested, but he broke free of his imprisonment and sought shelter from the last vestiges of his allies in France. Arno and Élise found and interrogated Robespierre, learning that Germain was hiding in the Temple. Robespierre was arrested again and sent to be executed the following morning.<br><br>Arno and Élise infiltrated the Temple to find Germain. Upon Arno locating him, Germain used the Sword of Eden to fire a burst of electricity at him. After a fight at the Temple’s central tower, Germain fled to the catacombs. Arno entered the catacombs and found the entrance to the Templar vault. Élise then appeared and distracted Germain, allowing Arno to attack. Élise then fought Germain alone, but the Sword’s power was rendered unstable. The Sword exploded, killing Élise and mortally wounding Germain in the process. In an act of grief, Arno slowly assassinated Germain by stabbing him in the throat with his Hidden Blade. In a vision following his death, Germain explained his struggle of being a Sage, and his beliefs in de Molay\'s and Élise\'s unfortunate deaths. As Germain finally succumbed to his wounds, Arno carried Élise\'s body out from the Temple, leaving behind Germain\'s lifeless body inside.<br><br>Some time later, Arno, as a Master Assassin, walked through Paris, and reflected on his own beliefs about the Creed not being a grant of permission to do as he would, but a warning that everyone is responsible for their actions and its consequences. In 1808, Arno entered the Temple once more, accompanied by Napoleon. There, they discovered Germain\'s corpse which had long since decayed, and buried his skeletal remains in the Catacombs of Paris. This left Bishop satisfied, as the bones would be difficult for Abstergo to locate and were likely too degraded for DNA extraction.

Let\'s wake them up then, shall we?\"</i><br>―Jacob Frye, Assassin\'s Creed: Syndicate debut trailer.<br><br>Assassin\'s Creed: Syndicate is the ninth main installment in the Assassin\'s Creed series. The conceptual title and screenshots of the game were first leaked on 2 December 2014, following which Ubisoft acknowledged the leaked assets then code-named Assassin\'s Creed: Victory as being genuine.<br>The game was released on 23 October 2015 worldwide on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while the PC version released on 19 November 2015.[1]<br><br>The game has the player take on the role of an Initiate as they explore the story of the twin protagonists, Jacob and Evie Frye, both of whom are playable.

To stop their rule, the Fryes will take over the organized crime in an effort to gather an army and free London.<br><br>Assassin\'s Creed: Syndicate is set primarily in 19th century London, during the Victorian era.'),
(50, 9, 'Gameplay', '<h4>Location</h4>Syndicate\'s London is 30% bigger than Paris from Assassin\'s Creed: Unity and is composed of seven boroughs: Westminster, the Strand, the City of London, The Thames, Whitechapel, Southwark, and Lambeth.<br><br>To create as much contrast between these areas as possible, certain architectural styles were isolated to certain boroughs.<br><br>Because photography had already been invented by the time of the Industrial Revolution, the developers had a rich bank of real footage and photos to aid them in their recreation of London. Still, the city was streamlined to accommodate gameplay; the landmarks\' locations are geographically accurate, but the distance in between them was adjusted.<br><br>While London is the main setting of the game, locations outside of London will be visited during the storyline.<br><br>There are drastic architectural changes between Unity and Syndicate, including larger avenues and more floors in higher buildings. These changes conducted to the addition of the rope launcher to the Assassin\'s arsenal, to facilitate the navigation through the city.<br><br><h4>Transportation and activities</h4> Carriages serve as the fastest vehicular mode of transportation through the city, with the crowds now being restricted to the pavements on the sides of the road. Trains and steamboats also appear, and are primarily used to travel the city, though boats are restricted as freerunning platforms across the Thames, while the Assassins possess a Train Hideout that crosses the city.<br><br>To liberate the boroughs of London, various activities are available, including bounty hunting, Templar assassinations, attacking strongholds and liberating children from factories. Once the Templars\' control over the area was sufficiently weakened, a gang war would be initiated, culminating in the borough being taken over entirely by the Assassins\' gang, the Rooks.<br><br>Money is counted in pounds, and can be procured by completing missions, pickpocketing, opening chests, participating in street races, winning in fight clubs and accomplishing train robberies, and cargo escorts. Many of these activities additionally award materials, which are required for crafting certain items and upgrades.<br><br>Kidnapping is introduced as both a stealth mechanic and mission objective. The former allows for any enemy not aware of Jacob/Evie, to be kidnapped and used as a form of blending, allowing access to restricted areas. During kidnapping, a ring appears around the characters, signifying how close other enemies can get before realizing the ruse. It shortens the slower they walk, and increased greatly if running. Occasionally, the victim will try to escape, needing to be restrained. When their purpose is over, they can be assassinated or knocked out. For missions, primarily Bounty Hunts, targets can be kidnapped, and loaded in carriages.<br><br><h4>Characters, customization and weapons</h4> Both playable characters have different skill trees and the Frye twins\' play-styles reflects their different personalities. With a few exceptions you can switch at will between characters between the missions.<br><br>The Assassins amass a variety of equipment at their disposal, but begin the game with a hidden blade on their Assassin gauntlet, smoke bombs and throwing knives. Throwing knives have the new feature of activating traps in the environment such as hanging barrels. As the story progresses a rope launcher and dart launcher are added to the Assassin gauntlets. Hallucinogenic darts can be fired from the gauntlet into individuals, or they can be fired into fires to affect a wider area. The rope launcher can be used to quickly climb buildings, and on the rooftops can be used to create temporary zip lines. Handguns are available, including derringers, revolvers and semi-automatic pistols. Brass knuckles, cane-swords and kukris are available melee weapons, but each twin may equip only one weapon at a time. Owing to the era\'s stricter regulations on carrying weapons, the playable characters conceal their weapons when not in use.<br><br>As the reckless and brawler twin, Jacob begins the game with a pair of brass knuckles. Evie, being level-headed and less exuberant than her brother, is more focused on stealth. She begins the game with a cane sword. Both twins may use any unlocked weapons and gauntlets, but they have their own items of clothing; Evie\'s cloaks and Jacob\'s belts both provide bonuses to defense and stealth, but cloaks give a greater bonus to stealth while belts provide a stronger defense. These items are worn in addition to their outfits.<br><br> <h4>Experience points and levelling</h4> By performing Assassin-like actions, such as air assassinations, and completing missions, players gain experience points. For every 1000 experience points, a skill point is unlocked which can then be spent to unlock a particular skill, though higher skills require multiple points. Spending certain amounts of points with Jacob and Evie determines their level.<br><br>The Rooks under their control can also be upgraded. This manifests as stronger combat prowess (increased level); varied archetypes; reduced effectiveness of enemy blades, firearms, and vehicles; faster and stronger vehicles becoming more abundant in the streets; economic opportunities to increase revenue; and discounts on certain items from vendors.<br><br><h4>Combat</h4> Due to the era\'s restriction on open weaponry, much of the combat is carried out through fistfights, though weapons such as kukris, cane-swords, and brass knuckles are often employed as well. The combat mechanics will be similar to Unity, but at a quicker pace. Contextual kills will also make a return from Assassin\'s Creed: Rogue, and allow the stunning of multiple opponents, before chaining together a series of quick multi-kills.<br><br><h4>Other</h4> There is no competitive or co-op multiplayer game mode in Syndicate, the developers instead choosing to concentrate their efforts on the single-player content.<br><br>Syndicate also offers microtransactions. However, Ubisoft has stated that all in-game content can be unlocked through conventional means; with the microtransactions being there as an option for people who wish to save time on gameplay and accelerate their progress.<br><br>Contrary to most previous installments, which spanned about a decade, Syndicate\'s main storyline takes place entirely during the year 1868.'),
(51, 9, 'Plot', '<h4>Present</h4>In 2015, Bishop contacts the Helix Initiate to help herself and fellow Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane locate a Piece of Eden in London. Through camera drones, the Initiate watches the pair of Assassins conduct their field work and download the memories of the twins Jacob and Evie Frye.<br><br><h4>Past<h4> By 1868, London had fallen under the control of the Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick, who controlled the city\'s vast industrial base and politicians through a network of lieutenants, keeping the Templars in power and oppressing the working classes. In 1868, controlling London meant controlling the British Empire. Henry Green, leader of the remaining Assassins in the city, wrote to his friend George Westhouse to petition the Assassin Council of Crawley for aid.<br><br>In Croydon, the Frye twins coordinated with Westhouse to remove the Templar threat of Rupert Ferris and David Brewster. While Jacob assassinated Ferris inside his steel foundry, Evie assassinated Brewster in his laboratory, but the Piece of Eden she hoped to recover was destroyed. However, she learned that the Templars had already found a new one. The twins returned to Westhouse to report their accomplishments. Impatient to journey to London, the twins were scolded by the older Assassin, claiming that the Templars were too strong to take on so soon. Fed up with waiting to strike at their enemies, Evie and Jacob defied the Council\'s orders and traveled to London.<br><br>When the twins arrived, they met with Henry. The Frye twins then began to disagree on the right course of action; Jacob wanted to form a gang called the Rooks to challenge the Templar-controlled gang Blighters and cripple Starrick\'s control, while Evie wanted to find the Piece of Eden in his possession. The twins made alliances with Sergeant Frederick Abberline and Clara O\'Dea. Jacob and Evie set out to kill Blighter leader Rexford Kaylock and take over Whitechapel once and for all. With Kaylock dead, Whitechapel fell under the control of the Rooks. Jacob and Evie also acquired a broken rope launcher and a train that served as their new headquarters.<br><br>Henry took Evie and Jacob to meet Alexander Graham Bell, a scientist and inventor who would be able to repair the rope launcher. The twins also helped Bell set up an independent telegraph line to break Starrick\'s monopoly over the media. Back at the train, they made the acquaintance of Ned Wynert and began planning their next move.Jacob investigated the source of Starrick\'s Soothing Syrup, a cheap narcotic keeping London\'s poor districts passive and under control. Aided by Charles Darwin, Jacob destroyed the distillery where the syrup was being produced and learned that its creator was John Elliotson. Jacob assassinated Elliotson, causing the Templars to take further note of his and Evie\'s actions in London.<br><br>Meanwhile, Evie followed a lead on the Piece of Eden and recovered a book containing information on it. Following hidden information in the book, she and Henry later infiltrated the Kenway Mansion to continue the search for the Piece of Eden. They learned that Edward Kenway had found a Shroud of Eden, which possessed powers of regeneration and healing, and had left clues as to its location.<br><br>Jacob then worked on ending Starrick\'s control of London\'s transport. He introduces himself to Pearl Attaway, chief competitor to Starrick\'s omnibus company owned by Malcolm Millner, and reluctantly established a business partnership with her to destroy the Millner Company. Jacob performed jobs for Attaway, such as stealing a set of internal combustion engines from the Millner Company, and then assassinating Millner. Jacob then learned that Attaway was Starrick\'s cousin and fellow Templar, and that she had manipulated him all along. Dismayed, Jacob assassinated Attaway and learned of another Templar plot. Starrick was devastated by the death of his cousin, and ordered an increase in the Templar presence in the city.<br><br>Meanwhile, Evie visited Lambeth, which was overrun with counterfeit tonics and medicine after Elliotson\'s death. Evie recovered medical supplies for the Lambeth Asylum, allowing Florence Nightingale to save an ill Clara and establish better medical care for the borough. Evie later searched for the Shroud of Eden at the Monument to the Great Fire of London. Although she found the key to the vault holding the Shroud, she lost it to Lucy Thorne after a struggle with her.<br><br>While Evie went after Thorne, Jacob targeted Starrick\'s financial interests. He met with Abberline, who was also investigating and informed Jacob of a planned robbery of the Bank of England. Jacob uncovered the orchestrator of the robbery as Philip Twopenny and assassinated him before the robbery could take place.<br><br>Evie visited Southwark, rescuing Edward Bayley from threats by the Blighters. Bayley, as the only omnibus manufacturer in London, informed her that after the downfall of their omnibus businesses Attaway Transport and Millner Company, the Blighters were demanding that he work for them. Evie helped Bayley and his associates found the London General Omnibus Company, ending the Blighters\' monopoly over the transport sector. Evie then infiltrated the Tower of London to find the Shroud of Eden. She crossed paths with Thorne and assassinated her, reclaiming the key in her possession.<br><br>Jacob discovered a Templar plot to assassinate Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. He rescued Disraeli and his wife Mary Anne from a group of thugs hired to attack the Disraelis. While Jacob was acting as a bodyguard for Mary Anne, she identified the man behind the attack as the Earl of Cardigan. Jacob assassinated Cardigan at the Palace of Westminster, severely diminishing Starrick\'s political influence.<br><br>After the death of Twopenny, Britain\'s economy was left in danger and counterfeiters had stolen printing plates from the Bank of England. Abberline had Evie recover the plates and return them to the Bank, restoring faith in the economy and preventing a financial breakdown. Later, Evie and Henry set out to steal the plans for the vault holding the Shroud, but were unsuccessful.<br><br>Jacob received an invitation to meet with Maxwell Roth, the leader of the Blighters, who proposed an alliance against Starrick. He agreed, despite Evie\'s warnings, and together, they began to undermine Starrick\'s criminal and economic power throughout the city. Jacob helped Roth kidnap three of Starrick\'s important associates, but as they continued, Jacob grew perturbed by Roth\'s tactics. After Roth\'s attempt to destroy one of Starrick\'s workhouses with children inside, Jacob cut his ties with the crimeboss. Roth then invited him to a performance at the Alhambra Music Hall. Aware of Roth\'s malevolent intentions, Jacob resolved to assassinate him. Once Jacob was inside the theatre, Roth set the place ablaze with the guests still inside. Jacob was able to assassinate Roth and escape the burning theatre, provoking Starrick to personally take action against the Assassins and attempt to reinstate his control over London.<br><br>After an argument over each other\'s methods, Jacob and Evie decided to kill Starrick and recover the Shroud in one final mission together, after which they would part ways. To do so, Jacob acquired invitations and a carriage for himself and Evie to the Queen\'s Ball at Buckingham Palace, and a Royal Guard uniform for Abberline, who could smuggle in weapons for them. Meanwhile, Evie drove for Duleep Singh and several politicians in exchange for learning that the plans to the Buckingham Palace crypt could be found in the White Drawing Room of Buckingham Palace.<br><br>Jacob and Evie infiltrated the Queen\'s Ball to confront Starrick and secure the Shroud of Eden. However, Evie lost her Precursor necklace to Starrick and ordered her brother to locate the crypt. Jacob made his way to the vault, finding Starrick wearing the Shroud, but failed to attack him. Evie reached the vault and fought the Templar one on one but the Shroud prevented her from dealing much damage. Henry arrived and joined the fight, but he too was knocked off his feet by the Templar. Jacob and Evie continued the fight and managed to remove the Shroud and end Starrick\'s life. With the Templar threat gone, the rift between the siblings was mended. Jacob returned the Shroud to the vault as Evie attended to Henry. Shortly thereafter, the Assassins met with Queen Victoria, who knighted them into the Order of the Sacred Garter for their efforts in saving her life.<br><br><h4>Present</h4>\r\nThanks to the Initiate\'s work, Shaun, Rebecca and Master Assassin Galina Voronina find the vault where the Shroud had been stored. The Initiate then watches as the group of Assassins engage Isabelle Ardant and her escorts, Juhani Otso Berg and Violet da Costa. During the struggle, Ardant is killed by Shaun, but ultimately Violet manages to escape with the artifact. Despite the loss of the Shroud, Bishop is confident they will recover it in time and thanks the Initiate for their efforts.<br><br>Bishop then sends them a final piece of footage from Abstergo\'s computers: Violet and Dr. Álvaro Gramática discussing their plans for the Shroud: instead of cloning a member of the First Civilization, they intend to recreate one from scratch using the Shroud\'s cellular level healing ability. The footage then shows Violet talking to a woman, telling her that she\'s scared of what will happen to her if anyone found out what she was doing. The woman, revealed to be Juno, tells Violet not to worry, for Violet has played her part well, and that she will save the world.');

Bayek\'s role as a Medjay brings him and Aya into contact with the secretive forces manipulating these events and into becoming the first Hidden Ones.<br><br><h4>Plot</h4>In the present day, Layla Hassan, a researcher at Abstergo Entertainment\'s Historical Research Division, is tasked along with her friend and co-worker Deanna Geary with finding and retrieving an artifact in Egypt. However, she instead finds a tomb containing the mummies of ancient Hidden ones Bayek and Aya. Hoping to find any relevant information that would secure her a position in the company\'s Animus Project, Layla decides to relive both Bayek and Aya\'s genetic memories using her modified Animus without telling her superiors, despite Deanna\'s protest.<br><br>In 49 BCE, Bayek, a respected Medjay in charge of protecting the Siwa Oasis, is abducted along with his son Khemu by a group of five masked men to an underground vault in the Temple of Amun. The masked men give Bayek a golden orb and demand that he use it to open a secret Vault. Khemu helps Bayek escape, but during the struggle to kill one of the masked men, Bayek inadvertently stabs Khemu in the chest, killing him.<br><br>One year later, in 48 BCE, Bayek had exiled himself from Siwa in order to track down the five masked men to take his revenge. He finds the first one, Rudjek, \"The Heron\", and kills him. Bayek then returns to Siwa to kill the local priest Medunamun, \"The Ibis\", who has been torturing Siwans for information to open the same vault. After killing Medunamun, Bayek then heads for Alexandria, where Aya has been tracking another of the masked men. Upon meeting Aya, she reveals that she has already killed \"The Vulture\" and \"The Ram\", leaving only one target left, \"The Snake\". Aya also reveals that she has been working with Apollodorus and Cleopatra to uncover The Snake\'s identity. She gives Bayek the very first Hidden Blade. Bayek discovers that \"The Snake\" is Eudoros, the royal scribe, and tracks him to a bathhouse. Bayek kills Eudoros with the Hidden Blade, at the cost of his own left ring finger, cut off by the same blade.<br><br>Bayek remembers Eudoros\' words and begins to have doubts. He decides to meet with Apollodorus and Cleopatra for answers. Cleopatra tells Bayek that she was ousted from the throne by the masked men, who call themselves the Order of the Ancients and seek to control all of Egypt by using Ptolemy as their puppet. In addition, there are more members of Order than the five Bayek and Aya had already killed: \"The Scarab\", \"The Hyena\", \"The Lizard\", and \"The Crocodile\". In fact, Eudoros was actually \"The Hippo\", and the name of \"The Snake\" is used to refer to the Order as a whole.

With no other options, Cleopatra has Bayek and Aya help sneak her into the palace in order to meet Julius Caesar. Cleopatra is able to impress Caesar and secure his support.

Regretting his mistake in supporting Cleopatra, Bayek gathers all of the allies he has made and decides to form a brotherhood to counter the Order and defend the free will of the common people. Bayek and Aya recall the great interest the Order showed in the tomb of Alexander the Great and they go to investigate. There, they find a mortally wounded Apollodorus who warns them that Caesar\'s lieutenant, Flavius Metellus, is \"The Lion\" and the true leader of the Order.

(57, 10, 'Gameplay', 'Origins\' map encompasses Lower Egypt and eastern Libya, which can be explored seamlessly without encountering loading screens, and has been described to be \"the size of Black Flag\'s Caribbean, but on the ground\". Players are able to visit major cities such as Giza, Memphis, Cyrene and Alexandria, as well as various smaller villages and settlements in Faiyum and the Nile Delta.<br><br>Unlike previous Assassin\'s Creed games, Origins has no mini-map, instead employing an Elder Scrolls-esque compass bar that points the player in the direction of quests and objects of interest. Senu, Bayek\'s eagle companion, functions as the game\'s \"Eagle Vision\", being used to detect and mark enemies. The aerial perspective she brings also allows players to locate treasure chests, crafting resources and hidden passages. As well as this, Senu can be upgraded to distract or attack enemies. Using Senu does not defog parts of the map, this requires the player themselves to step into the fogged area of the map to defog it. Interiors are accessible, and the Library of Alexandria is available for exploration. Although it does not feature the traditional \"Eagle Vision\", it does feature \"Animus Pulse\" which only highlights objects.<br><br>As a result of Senu\'s introduction, viewpoints are no longer primarily used to reveal information about an area and its surroundings. Instead, they serve as a way to increase the eagle\'s detection capacity. Synchronizing a viewpoint also allows the player to fast travel to it, a mechanic that has carried over from previous games.<br><br>Underwater environments return from Black Flag, with players now being able to dive in any sufficiently deep body of water to explore wrecks and underwater ruins in search of loot. Since hostile animals such as crocodiles and hippos inhabit these waters, an underwater melee combat system was also created. In terms of transportation, Bayek can use feluccas to traverse the water, and horses, camels and chariots to travel on land.<br><br>In addition, there are 20 tombs to explore; some of these are based on real-life locations, while others are fictional. The tombs contain traps and some light puzzles, but they are, at their core, more about exploration and uncovering treasure. To navigate these darker spaces, Bayek can light torches and even set things on fire.<br><br><h4>RPG elements</h4>Much like Syndicate, Origins features a progression system where completing certain actions earns the player experience. Leveling up not only makes Bayek stronger, it also grants ability points that can be spent to unlock skills from the game\'s skill tree. There are three main branches in this tree:<br><ul><li><b>Master Warrior</b>, which focuses on melee combat.</li><li><b>Master Hunter</b>, which focuses on ranged combat and stealth.</li><li><b>Master Seer</b>, which focuses on tools and manipulating the environment.</li></ul><br>In addition to skills, there is a full crafting system, based on materials gathered through hunting, which can be used to improve Bayek\'s equipment, such as the Hidden Blade. This is necessary when assassinating higher level enemies, which will not die from one blow if the Hidden Blade has not been sufficiently upgraded.<br><br>Origins also moves away from the mission structure of previous entries in the franchise, instead utilizing quests that the player has to pick up in the open world and can then pursue at their leisure without desynchronizing.<br><br>Desert Overheat is another RPG element being introduced with Origins. Essentially players can develop heatstroke due to being in the desert for too long. The system introduces varying effects depending on the severity of Desert Overheat.<br><br><h4>Combat</h4>The combat system was completely overhauled for Origins, now utilizing a hitbox system. As a result, positioning, as well as the size and the speed of the equipped weapon, determine whether or not an attack hits. In addition, while a heavier weapon like a mace might deal a lot of damage per strike, it can leave the player open to more counter-attacks than if they were using a light sword. Players can also use Bayek\'s shield to block enemy attacks or bash opponents to create an opening.<br><br>In addition to a revised combat system, there is a new Adrenaline Gauge that builds up energy during combat, giving the player the ability to either unleash devastating finishing moves on their enemy or make Bayek enter a frenzy, during which he is temporarily faster, stronger and more resistant to damage.<br><br>Origins features a variety of weapons, including swords, bows, heavy weapons, long weapons, bombs, and shields. In total, there are over 150 weapons in the game, ranging in rarity from \"common\" to \"legendary\", that all have pros and cons within Origins\'s new combat system. Some weapons also have specific attributes, such as a larger chance to deal critical damage or bleed properties. Unarmed melee combat also makes a return from Assassin\'s Creed: Syndicate.<br><br>The game will also include boss fights against formidable warriors and strange creatures.<br><br><h4>Other</h4>Some features that had been frequently requested by the fanbase were introduced into the game: players are able to toggle Bayek\'s hood on and off in the menu screen and multiple save files are making their return after having been absent in Assassin\'s Creed: Unity and Syndicate. Players can also fast forward to a particular time of day; tackling missions at night, for example, means some of the guards will be asleep, allowing Bayek to sneak through without attracting much attention.<br><br>Origins is primarily a single-player experience, but the game included some online features to enhance that experience. For example, at times the player can find the corpse of another player and take on a quest to exact revenge.'),

Ubisoft Sofia, Ubisoft Singapore, Ubisoft Shanghai, Ubisoft Chengdu, Ubisoft Bucharest, Ubisoft Kiev, and the Sperasoft studio are also collaborating on the development of the game.<br><br>Due to the setting being further back in time than previous entries in the franchise, history books did not always suffice as reference. To compensate, Maxime Durand worked closely with various historians and Egyptian experts to fill in the blanks where needed. In some cases, the lack of reference meant the Art team had to create the look and overall feel of what Ancient Egypt would have been like at the time.<br><br>A new Artificial Intelligence framework was also created from the ground up, since the developers wanted the non-player characters, both human and animal, to have their own agenda and activities. Full day cycles were created to make the world feel dynamic and alive.<br><br>To refine how the game displayed colors, the team designed a new color-grading feature to help them create specific and unique color ambiances. They also used satellite images of Egypt to fine-tune the colors for the ground and the vegetation and make them as realistic as possible.<br><br>Another visual aspect that received a lot of attention was lighting; the developers studied technical documentation from NASA to better understand how airborne particles impact lighting. Similarly, they looked at the ways in which different sediments refract light to realistically depict different types of water, which can communicate to the player what kinds of wildlife they might encounter in it.<br><br>In June 2022, the game was patched to support 60fps on consoles. Particularly more optimized for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.'),
(59, 11, 'Assassin\'s Creed: Odyssey', 'Assassin\'s Creed: Odyssey is the eleventh main installment in the Assassin\'s Creed series developed by Ubisoft.'),
(60, 11, 'Plot', 'The game\'s genetic memory story is set in 431 BCE as the starting year, recounting the secret history of the Peloponnesian War, fought between the city-states of ancient Greece. The protagonist is a mercenary named either Alexios or Kassandra (selectable) who can choose to fight for either Athens and the Delian League or Sparta and the Peloponnesian League, as well as against the Cult of Kosmos. The modern day segments will again follow Layla Hassan, who was first introduced in Assassin\'s Creed Origins, and her story will touch on the Isu. The game is said to deal with the themes of \"freedom versus order.\"'),
(61, 11, 'Gameplay', 'Odyssey uses a lot of the gameplay and interface mechanics of Origins, including the radial compass, and the return of a bird that can survey the landscape, spot treasure, and highlight and harass enemies. The game features RPG elements, including dialogue options, branching quests, multiple possible endings, romance options, and the ability to select between a male or female protagonist. The game is a \"full RPG\" and pushed the franchise deeper into this genre. Both Alexios and Kassandra follow the same story. Romance options remain the same regardless of the character chosen.<br><br>Gear can be selected, and is classified by rarity. Each piece of gear can be enhanced with engravings. Players also have access to a skill tree, and can follow a \'branch\' to better suit their playstyle. Compared to Origins, the skill tree is more clear cut in Odyssey, and players can unlock high tier versions of pre-existing skills. In combat, the hitbox system for enemies is used again.<br><br>Trade Goods can also be collected or sold. These items range in value depending on rarity, such as legendary items.<br><br>The game world has been described as the \"biggest one yet\" for the franchise; specifically, the game map is 100 square miles, split evenly between land and sea. Environments range from forests, to mountains, to beaches. \"Legendary animals\" can be hunted on land. The world is divided into a number of zones divided by level (similar to an MMO), but level scaling features to a point. For instance, if a player starts at a level 2 zone, then returns after having reached level 20, the enemies there will be scaled up to be 2-3 below the player\'s character.<br><br>The game features a dynamic weather system.<br><br>The Sparta-Athens divide is represented in-game with a red or blue border along each region to indicate which of the city-states has control. 28 city-states feature in the game, each of which is allied with either Sparta or Athens. Each city-state has a \"nation power\" level. If one city-state leader is weakened (e.g. by assassinating their leader), other faction leaders will invade their state. If the invading army is defeated, the nation power is reset. The army will invade regardless of the player\'s actions, but they can involve themselves in the battle.<br><br>Players will no longer desynchronize if they kill innocents in the game and some civilians will fight back if attacked.<br><br><h4>Naval combat</h4>Players will have access to the ship Adrestia, used to sail the Aegean Sea in a similar manner as the ships in Assassin\'s Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin\'s Creed: Rogue. Crew can be recruited, and in a sense, it serves as a mobile hub. Sharks can be found in the seas, which will attack the player as well as their enemies. The Adrestia can be customized with options such as crew cosmetics, ram/hull upgrades, and new sails and figureheads.<br><br>In terms of combat, the Adrestia opens up more combat options as players increase their overall damage against an adversary, such as the options of fire arrows and fiery javelins. Focus-firing on specific points causes increasing damage and opens that point up to an attack by the ship\'s ram. Ramming helps to refill a portion of the Adrestia\'s health. Additionally, in relation to past naval combat in the series, the Adrestia has the ability to slow down and turn very quickly depending on how rowers are used. Compared to previous games, the naval combat in Odyssey is more focused on close-quarters rather than long ranged attacks. Ramming and sideswiping are two such tactics, along with being able to turn quickly and drift. Player\'s can temporarily \'boost\' their ship (measured in a meter) to give their ship a speed increase.<br><br>Enemy ships are divided into sections. If players focus their attacks on one particular section, the ship will burst into flames, leaving it stunned. \'Epic ships\' sail in the outer reaches of the game map, which will grant the player exclusive cosmetics if taken down.<br><br>Players can recruit \"Lieutenants\" throughout the world through simple conversation or combat. Each Lieutenant comes with their own perk, and there are different types of recruits that range from archers to brawlers.<br><br><h4>Mercenary System</h4>Odyssey also introduces a Mercenary System, whereby players may become the focus of a bounty through their gameplay decisions, such as committing crimes. With this system, there are more than 50 potential mercenaries they can encounter, with some having animal companions. There are multiple ways to deal with them, including killing, paying them off, or even recruiting them. Even if the player kills or recruits them, however, mercenaries will continue to pursue the bounty. The Mercenary System has rankings, and at higher rankings, players will be able to unlock certain perks, such as discounts. Some of the mercenaries are hand-crafted, equipped with backstories and unique legendary items. Others are generated from the pool.<br><br>Players can find themselves as the target of bounties, which can come about from actions such as killing civilians, and they will be hunted on the sea. The player will also take part in mass battles, some of which are story-relevant, while others are optional. The player has a \'penalty level\' that escalates if they commit crimes such as killing civilians, stealing, or sinking merchant ships. This system has been likened to the \'wanted level\' in the Grand Theft Auto series. The higher the bounty, the higher the level of mercenary that comes after the player.'),
(62, 11, 'Development', 'The game was primarily developed by Ubisoft Québec, which had previously worked on Assassin\'s Creed: Syndicate. The concept for the game emerged in 2015, as the team was wrapping up development on Syndicate. In the shift to an RPG-esque game, inspiration was taken from titles such as The Witcher 3, Fallout, and The Elder Scrolls, in regards to the idea of player choice. The development team engaged in communication with the team behind Assassin\'s Creed: Origins; it was decided to \"push [the series] forward\" with the introduction of RPG elements. The setting of ancient Greece was chosen as it was one of the most requested settings from the fanbase.<br><br>Odyssey uses a lot of the same graphical technology as Origins. Far more color was used in the game; the designers tried to tap into the notion that the ancient Greeks believed that their land was built by the gods, thus the use of vibrant colors. There was pushback against the \"ordinary\" depictions of ancient Greece, which lean on it being an arid place with an emphasis on white and gold. The end result is intended to be a middle-ground between historical accuracy and vibrancy.<br><br>The game was announced on 31 May 2018 and it received weekly updates post-release.'),
(63, 11, 'Controversy', 'Following the January 2019 release of the second chapter for the three-part downloadable expansion Legacy of the First Blade, entitled Shadow Heritage, it drew criticism from the LGBT+ community for a developer decision and the corresponding achievement. As first reported on the Assassin\'s Creed board on Reddit, the episode concluded with a cut-scene revealing that the protagonist had entered into a heterosexual relationship and had a child, regardless of whether players had been invested in the romance or not.<br><br>Fans took to social media and other boards to express their dissatisfaction at the story development, condemning Ubisoft for promoting a game where player agency could define the protagonist\'s sexuality—a decision for which the company had received loud acclaim—only to take that control away and force the protagonist to \"embrace domesticity, a heterosexual relationship, and [parent]hood\", all elements of traditionally hetero-normative society.<br><br>In light of the furor, many drew attention to a seemingly contradictory quote by Creative Director Jonathan Dumont in his October 2018 interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying \"Since the story is choice-driven, we never force players in romantic situations they might not be comfortable with. Players decide if they want to engage with characters romantically. I think this allows everybody to build the relationships they want, which I feel respects everybody\'s roleplay style and desires.\" Further issue was taken over the wording of the achievement unlocked at the cut-scene, titled Growing Up and with \"Start a family\" as its description. The next day, Dumont released a statement on the Ubisoft boards apologizing to players. On January 24, Ubisoft informed players that a patch changing some dialogue and cut-scenes was imminent and being tested to ensure it would be reflected in the DLC\'s final chapter. On February 15, a full month after Shadow Heritage\'s release, fan site Access the Animus reported that the trophy and its description had since been changed.'),

(66, 12, 'Plot', 'Driven from Norway by endless wars and dwindling resources in the ninth century CE, players will lead Eivor\'s clan of Norsemen across the icy North Sea to the rich lands of England\'s broken kingdoms.

Against all odds, Eivor must do what is necessary to keep Valhalla within reach.'),
(67, 12, 'Gameplay', 'Set in 873 CE, Valhalla has players take the role of Eivor, a Viking Raider and Clan Leader of the Norsemen who can be played either as male or female. The game retains the dialogue choice and NPC relationship elements from Assassin\'s Creed: Odyssey, with new elements such as forging political alliances with NPC clans. Every choice and decision of the players affects the world of the game in real time.

Players can take part in activities like drinking games, hunting or traditional Norse games such as flyting. A player is able to create a Viking mercenary that can be recruited by other players, acting as a non-playable character within those games; the player gains additional in-game rewards for successful missions.'),
